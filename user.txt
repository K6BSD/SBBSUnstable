How to use the User's Manual
============================
 

Quick Key Sequence Guides
-------------------------
Each command title will be followed by a quick key sequence guide. The command 
sequences are the exact keystrokes to enter from the Main or File Transfer 
prompt to execute that command without pausing to look at menus. Key sequences 
to be entered from the Main prompt are enclosed in brackets. For example the 
Send E-Mail command title will be listed as:

	Send E-Mail [ES]

You would type E then S from the Main Prompt (noted by the brackets) to Send 
E-Mail. Key sequences to be entered from the File Transfer prompt are enclosed 
in parenthesis. For example the Find File command title would be listed as:

	Find File (F)

For this command you would type F from the File Transfer prompt (noted by the 
parenthesis). If a command may be entered from either the Main or File Transfer 
prompt it will be enclosed in curly brackets. For example the Join Multinode 
Chat command title would be listed as:

	Join/Initiate Multinode Chat {CJ} 

For this command you would type C then J from either the Main or File transfer 
prompt.



Nomenclature
------------
Throughout the documentation Carriage Return (or the ENTER key) is referred to 
as <CR>.

There are two primary prompts on the Synchronet BBS, the Main prompt from the 
Main section, and the File Transfer prompt, from the File Transfer section. 
These can be identified by diagrams in the Message Base Functions chapter and 
the File Transfer Section chapter. When referred to in the documentation the 
Main and File Transfer prompts are italicized.

Most key strokes referred to in the documentation are highlighted in bold. 

Logging onto the BBS
====================

After dialing and connecting to the BBS:

At NN: prompt enter your username or user number. 

At the PW: prompt enter your unique user password.



Logging off the BBS
===================

To logoff the BBS enter O from either the Main prompt or the File Transfer 
prompt. Enter /O for a quick logoff.


Displaying Menus
================

Hitting ? from almost any prompt will display a menu of available commands. 
From inside chat or the Synchronet editor /? will display a menu of the 
available commands.



Control Commands
================

Control commands are commands that are available from anywhere on the BBS. 
Control commands are primarily used to control the scrolling of text at anytime 
on the system or to abort a command in process such as a file search. Two 
online user to user commands are also available to list the users currently 
online or send messages at anytime while on the BBS. Control commands are 
entered by holding down the Ctrl key and hitting the control letter. For 
example, to enter the control command Ctrl-S hold down the Ctrl key and strike 
the S key. The following control commands are available at all times while on 
the BBS:

<sm heading>Scrolling Text/ Messages/ System Commands	
	Ctrl-S	Pause scrolling text/messages
	Ctrl-Q	Continue scrolling text/messages
	Ctrl-C	Abort scrolling text/messages or a BBS command

<sm heading>Online User Information/Interaction
	Ctrl-P	Send a private one line message to another user
	Ctrl-U	List users online

<sm heading>Other Information
	Ctrl-K	List control commands
	Ctrl-T	Time online info


Setting Up Your User Account
============================


Account Defaults Configuration [D]
----------------------------------
To display and or change your user account defaults hit D from the Main prompt. 
Your account defaults will be displayed. 

A) ANSI Terminal		: Yes, Color
E) External Editor		: None
L) Screen Length		: Auto Detect (24)
K) Command Keys		: Synchronet
X) Expert Menu Mode		: On
P) Screen Pause		: Off
S) Spinning Cursor		: Off
C) Clear Screen Between Messages		: Off
N) Prompt for New Message / File Scan		: Off
F) Auto New File Scan*		: Off
R) Remember Current Sub-board		: Off
B) Batch Download File Flagging		: Off
W) Change Password (if allowed)
Q) Quit (and accept settings)
 
The A) option toggles ANSI terminal support. The ANSI definition of terminal 
escape sequences used for text attributes and animation is supported by most 
communications programs and dumb terminals. If your terminal supports ANSI, 
this option should be set to "Yes". You can also tell the system if you have a 
color or monochrome display with this option.

The E) option selects an external editor as your default message editor. 
External editors may have more functionality or a command structure that you 
may prefer over the internal editor. You may only select external editors from 
a list that the sysop has configured for the system.

The L) option sets how many lines (or rows) your display has. If your terminal 
or communications program has a status line, you will want this set to the 
number of lines your terminal can display excluding the status line. If this 
option is set to "Auto Detect", the number of screen lines your terminal 
supports will be automatically detected upon each logon.

The K) option selects an optional command key set. You may select an alternate 
command key set resembling another BBS type or any command set the sysop has 
predefined. You may also define your own command set. If you select an 
alternate command set you will also receive matching menus. However, if you 
define your own set you will not receive matching menus.

The X) option toggles Expert menu mode on and off. When Expert menu mode is 
turned off menus automatically appear at each new command prompt. When Expert 
menu mode is turned on menus only appear as requested with the '?' command. 
Expert menu mode off is generally referred to as Novice mode.

The P) option toggles screen pausing. When this option is on, every screen full 
of text displayed to you will pause with a "Hit a key" prompt. When this option 
is off, the user must use the Ctrl-S and Ctrl-Q commands to pause and unpause 
scrolling text.

The S) option toggles the spinning cursor on and off

The C) option toggles screen clearing before each message (posts or E-mail) is 
displayed.

The N) option toggles whether or not the BBS will automatically prompt you for 
a new message and file scan upon logging on.

The F) option toggles automatic new file scanning  after a New Message Scan All 
(NA or /N) from the Main Section.

The R) option is used to toggle whether or not the BBS remembers your current 
subboard each time you logoff.

The B) option is used to toggle the Batch Download File Flagging prompt that is 
displayed after each screen full of files are listed to you. This function is 
handy for quickly adding files to the batch download queue without having to 
type the name of each file. Batch Download File Flagging can be temporarily 
toggled with the &B command from the Transfer Section.

The W) option is not available on all systems. If the sysop has configured the 
system so that users can edit their passwords, this option will appear on the 
menu and allow you to change your current password.

Electronic Mail Functions
=========================


Electronic Mail Menu [E]
------------------------
Selecting E from the Main prompt brings you to the E-mail Prompt. From here you 
can read, send, and kill E-mail (mail to and from users on your BBS) and 
NetMail (mail to and from users on other BBSs). Your E-mail options are:

	S	Send E-mail
	N	Send NetMail
	R	Read E-Mail\NetMail
	K	Read\Kill mail you have sent
	F	Send feedback to the sysop
	Q	Quit to the Mail Menu
	

Send E-mail [ES]
----------------
Select Send E-Mail to send a mail message to another user's mailbox. You will 
be prompted for the user's name or user number. If you don't know the correct 
spelling for the target user and don't know the user number, you can enter in 
just part of the user's name and the system will help you find the user's full 
name. Enter the message title then your message. All Synchronet editor commands 
are available to you (see Synchronet Message Editor) in the message unless you 
have selected another (external) editor as your default editor. /S will save 
and send your message when you are finished.



Send NetMail [EN]
-----------------
Select Send NetMail to send a personal message to user on another BBS across a 
Fidonet style network. This feature works exactly like the Send E-Mail command 
except that you will be prompted for the user's name and Fidonet address. The 
syntax is as follows:

	Username @Fidonet Address

	Ex: John Doe  @1:138:110


Read Mail [ER]
--------------
After selecting Read Mail you will receive a list of the mail messages in your 
mailbox. An *  will be displayed next to any unread mail messages. If you have 
only one message in your mailbox, that message will be displayed rather than 
the list. Either event will be followed by the Read Mail prompt. At the Read 
Mail prompt you have the following commands available:
	#	read a mail message (where # is the number of the message).
	<CR>	read the next mail message.
	- 	read the previous mail message.
	L	list all mail message titles and authors.
	R	re-read the current mail message.
	D	delete the current mail message.
	A	automatically reply in mail to the author of the current mail message. 				This 
will prompt for mail message removal.
	F	forward the current mail message to another user. This will 				automatically 
remove the mail message from your mailbox.
	Q	quit the Read Mail prompt and return to the Main prompt.
	?	display the Read Mail menu


Read Sent Mail [EK]
-------------------
After selecting Read Sent Mail you will receive a list of active mail messages 
you have sent and to whom you have sent them. An * next to a title denotes an 
unread mail message. If you have only one active mail message that message will 
be displayed rather than the list. Either event will be followed by the Read 
Sent Mail prompt. At the Read Sent Mail prompt the following commands are 
available:

	#	read a sent mail message (where # is the number of the message).
	<CR>	read the next sent mail message.
	- 	read the previous sent mail message.
	L	list all sent mail message titles and recipients.
	R	re-read the current sent mail message.
	D	delete the current sent mail message.
	Q	quit the Read Sent Mail prompt and return to the Main prompt.


Send Sysop Feedback [EF]
------------------------
Send Sysop Feedback sends a private  message to the Sysop. Again, all 
Synchronet editor commands are available to you (see Synchronet Message Editor) 
in the message unless you have selected another (external) editor as your 
default editor. /S will save and send your feedback when you are finished.

Message Base Functions
======================

The Synchronet message base is a two level system. It is organized in groups 
and subboards. A group is a generalized collection of related subboards. 
Subboards contain specific interest messages. 
Groups tend to be categories such as Public, Computers, 18 and Over, etc. 
Subboard categories are more specific such as: Public/Politics, Public/Game 
Hints,  Computers/Macintosh, Computers/DOS, Fidonet/For Sale, Fidonet/Trekkies, 
etc. 
At the Main prompt you can always see your current group and subboard. The Main 
prompt and the File Transfer prompt can be easily differentiated by the bracket 
style. The Main prompt uses square brackets [ ] and the File Transfer prompt 
uses parenthesis ( ). The first name and number is your current group. The 
second name and number is your current subboard. The clock displays your time 
left online unless you have a time exemption in which case it will display your 
time spent  online. ? will display the Main Menu. 

Group and Subboard Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are two ways to select groups and subboards. You can jump to the group 
and subboard #'s directly or you can jump through the groups and subboards 
sequentially until you reach the desired selection. If you wish to jump to the 
group and subboard #'s directly you may want to view a list of groups or 
subboards first. From the Main prompt enter:

	*	to list all available subboards in your current group
	/*	to list all available groups

	#	to jump to a new subboard (where # is the subboard number)
	/#	to jump to a new group (where # is the group number)
	
	} 	to jump forward to the next subboard
	{	to jump backward to the previous subboard
	]	to jump forward to the next group
	[	to jump backward to the previous group.

Reading Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To read messages in a subboard you can either go to the Read Messages prompt or 
you can scan for new messages. There are three different new scan commands 
available. All new scan commands can scan either your current subboard, all 
subboards in your current group, or all subboards in all groups. Remember that 
the control commands are available at all times while on the BBS to control 
text scrolling. Ctrl-S to pause, Ctrl-Q to continue, and Ctrl-C to abort. 


Read Messages [R]	
------------------
Read Messages, activated by hitting R at the Main prompt, is used to read 
messages sequentially forward or backward in your current subboard (displayed 
at the prompt). While reading messages you can also reply to and post messages. 
The following are the Read Message commands:

	<CR>	Display next message 
	-	Display previous message 
	L	Lists message titles and authors.
	T	Lists message titles and authors of next ten messages 					(advances current 
message forward ten messages)
	R	Re-read current message 
	F	Searches for specified text in all messages.
	B	Bypasses remaining messages in current subboard and moves to next 				subboard 
in new scan list if applicable.
	I	Displays information about current subboard
	Y	Lists posts addressed to you
	C	Displays remaining messages in current subboard continuously 				without 
pausing for a Message Scanning prompt.
	A	Reply publicly regarding current message.
	M	Reply privately in mail regarding current message.
	Z	Reply privately in message area regarding last message.
	D	Deletes only the last message in current subboard if you are the 				message's 
 author. 
	P	Post a message in current subboard. (see Synchronet Editor com-				mands)
	W	Post a private message in current subboard.
	Q	Quits to Main prompt.



New Message Scan [N]
--------------------
After selecting New Message Scan you will be prompted to scan for new messages 
in your current subboard, all subboards in your current group, or all subboards 
in all groups. Browse and Continuous New Scan will also prompt for these 
selections.

After each displayed message you are provided a Read Message prompt and may 
execute any Read Message  commands (See Read Messages). When <CR> is hit after 
the last message is displayed or the subboard is bypassed (B) the new scan will 
continue with the next subboard in the new scan list. "Group" and "All" new 
scans will skip over subboards that do not contain any new messages.

	Quick Keys:
		New Message Scan Subboard [NS]
		New Message Scan Group [NG]
		New Message Scan All [NA]


Browse [B]
----------
Browse works exactly like New Scan except on subboards that do not contain any 
new messages. Unlike New Scan Group, which will skip over a subboard that 
contains no new messages, Browse will display the last message read in a 
subboard that contains no new messages and provide you with a Read Message  
prompt (see Read Messages) allowing you to still read and post messages in that 
subboard. When <CR> is hit after the last message is displayed or the subboard 
is bypassed, by hitting B, the browse will continue with the next subboard in 
the new scan list.

	Quick Keys:
		Browse Subboard [BS]
		Browse Group [BG]
		Browse All [BA]


Continuous New Scan [Z]
-----------------------
Continuous New Scan displays all new messages continuously without providing a 
Message Scanning prompt.

	Quick Keys:
		Continuous New Scan Subboard [ZS]
		Continuous New Scan Group [ZG]
		Continuous New Scan All [ZA]

Posting Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Posting a message [P]
---------------------
To post (write) a message in your current subboard hit P from the Main or the 
Message Scanning prompt. You will also be prompted to post when you pass the 
last message in your current subboard when reading, new scanning, or browsing. 
After selecting Post Message you will be prompted whether to make the post 
private or public. When posting a message all Synchronet Editor commands are 
available to you (see Synchronet Message Editor) unless you have selected an 
external editor as your default editor. In which case you should consult the 
documentation for the external editor you have selected.



Private message vs E-mail & NetMail
-----------------------------------
Private Messages cannot be delivered directly into another user's mailbox as 
can E-mail or NetMail so when ever possible use E-mail and NetMail to send 
confidential messages to other users. However, QWK style BBS networks do not 
support NetMail. If you wish to send a confidential message to a user on 
another BBS through a QWK style network you should use a private message on a 
subboard. You can tell what types of networks are being utilized on a subboard 
by hitting I from the read message prompt or [IS] from the main prompt.  
NetMail is the most convenient and direct way to send confidential messages to 
users on other BBSs if the BBSs are connected to a Fidonet style network. (see 
also E-mail and NetMail)

Auto Message [A]
----------------
The auto message is displayed to every user when the user logs on. You may 
change the Auto Message from the Main prompt by hitting A. Remember that as 
soon as another user changes the Auto Message your message will be deleted.


Synchronet Message Editor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When using the Synchronet Message Editor to post, send mail, or send feedback 
you have a wealth of powerful message editing functions available. There are 
two types of editor commands available: Slash (/) commands and Control (Ctrl) 
commands. 

Slash commands are preceded by the forward slash key (/) and must be entered 
from the beginning of any new line. Control (Ctrl) commands may be entered from 
any cursor position on any line. 

There are two help menus available when in the editor. /? displays all standard 
message editing commands and /ATTR displays all available text attributes which 
can set by the Ctrl-A command. Text attributes set with the Ctrl-A command do 
not become visible until the line is word wrapped or a carriage return <CR> is 
entered.


Slash Commands (/)
------------------
	
	/?	Message editor help menu
	/S	Save message
	/ABT	Abort message
	/CLR	Clear message	
	/L	List message
	/Lx	List message from line number x
	/E	Edit last line
	/Ex	Edit line number x
	/D	Delete last line
	/Dx	Delete line number x
	/I	Insert line before last
	/Ix	Insert line before line number x
	/T	Edit message title
	/ATTR	Text attribute code list
	

Control (Ctrl) Commands
-----------------------
	
	Ctrl-C		Cancel current line
	Ctrl-V		Center current line
	Ctrl-R		Redraw current line
	Ctrl-X		Delete current line
	Ctrl-Y	*	Delete to end of line
	Ctrl-W		Delete word to left
	Ctrl-D	*	Delete word to right
	Ctrl-B	*	Move cursor to beginning of line
	Ctrl-E	*	Move cursor to end of line
	Ctrl-N	*	Move cursor to next word
	Ctrl-\	*	Move cursor to previous word
	Ctrl-F	*	Move cursor position forward one space
	Ctrl-Bkspc	*	Move cursor position back one space
	Ctrl-Minus	*	Toggle insert/overwrite mode
	Ctrl-Ax	*	Toggle new text attribute where x is attribute

* Requires ANSI


Text Attributes (Ctrl-Ax where x is attribute)
----------------------------------------------
	
	K	Black foreground	(zero) 0	Black background
	R	Red foreground	1	Red background
	G	Green foreground	2	Green background
	Y	Yellow foreground	3	Yellow background
	B	Blue foreground	4	Blue background
	M	Magenta foreground	5	Magenta background
	C	Cyan foreground	6	Cyan background
	W	White foreground	7	White background
	
	H	High intensity
	I	Blinking
	N	Normal (reset attributes)
	P	Insert pause into message
	L	Insert form feed into message



QWK Mail Packet Menu [Q]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hitting Q from the Main prompt accesses the QWK Mail Packet Menu. QWK mail 
packets are used in conjunction with an offline mail reader. When you download 
a QWK mail packet all of your new messages in all of the subboards flagged in 
your newscan list and a list of new uploaded files will be compiled into a QWK 
file readable by most QWK supported offline mail readers. After logging off the 
BBS you can read the messages, E-mail, and new files list with your offline 
reader. You can reply to and post messages from your offline reader and upload 
the reply packet (.REP) to the BBS and your messages will be posted for you. 
(see QWK Offline Reader Diagram) There are many offline readers available as 
shareware and commercial products. The QWK Mail Packet Menu offers the 
following commands:
	
	D	Download QWK message packet
	U	Upload REP reply packet
	B	Bidirectional simultaneous QWK & REP transfer 
	Q	Quit to Main prompt

When D or B is selected to download a QWK packet you will be prompted to select 
a what type of Ctrl-A filtering you wish to employ. Synchronet uses Ctrl-A 
codes in messages to signify color and other text attributes. 

	E	Expand the Ctrl-A codes to ANSI, which is recommended if you wish 				to 
display ANSI color and have an ANSI compatible offline reader. 
	L	Leave the Ctrl-A codes in. In which case you would need an offline 				reader 
capable of converting Ctrl-A codes to ANSI. 
	<CR>	Strip out the Ctrl-A codes, removing the color and other text 				attributes 
from the messages.

If you are not sure which method to use the safest bet is to just hit <CR> to 
strip out the Ctrl-A codes.

Your QWK packet will not contain any messages you have already read since you 
logged on. If you wish to reset your new message scan pointers back to their 
state when you logged on use the Reinitialize New Message Scan Pointers [&I] 
command before downloading your QWK packet. After downloading a QWK packet your 
New Message Scan Pointers will always be set to the last messages stored in the 
packet. If you wish to new scan messages while still online after downloading a 
QWK packet you may wish to use the [&I] or [&P] command before attempting a new 
message scan. (see Reinitialize New Message Scan Pointers and New Message Scan 
Date/Time Pointers in next section)

New Message Scan List Configuration [&N]
----------------------------------------
New Message Scan List Configuration, N from the Configuration prompt, allows 
you to set which subboards you wish to be scanned in a new scan, browse, or 
express new scan. When you select New Scan Configuration you will be prompted 
with a list of groups. Select the group number you wish to view. A list of 
subboards in the selected group will be displayed. An asterisk * next to a 
subboard designates the subboard is toggled ON for new scans. To toggle a 
subboard OFF select the subboard number. To toggle a subboard back ON, select 
the subboard number again. Hit Q to quit back to the group selection. Select 
another group or Q to quit back to the Main prompt. Your selections in the New

online or at any time you wish to reset your new message pointers back to their 
original state for your current logon. 

Online User Interaction
=======================


Users Online <Ctrl-U>
---------------------
To list users currently online enter Ctrl-U at any time from any section of the 
BBS. Users Online lists the user names, which nodes they are logged on to, 
their connect rate, and what each user's current action is on the BBS.


List Node Activity {/L}
-----------------------
List Node Activity, /L from the Main prompt, the File Transfer prompt, or from

simulating and understanding human conversation. The guru may be programmed to 
assist users in BBS usage or purely for entertainment. To enter a conversation 
with the Guru hit T from the Chat prompt.
  

Join/Initiate Multinode Chat {CJ}
---------------------------------
Multinode chatting is joined by hitting J from the Chat prompt. You are 
immediately placed in channel 1 of a 99 channel chat system. From this point 
any text you type will be sent out on the channel when you press <CR>. Entering 
a forward slash (/) will enter you into the Chat Command mode (see Chat Command 
prompt). Remember CTRL-U (list users online) and CTRL-P (send private message 
to another node) are available from anywhere on the BBS. 


Private Node to Node Chat {CP}
------------------------------
To initiate or join someone in a two way private node to node chat hit P from 
the Chat prompt. If you are initiating a private chat you will be prompted for 
the username you wish to chat with. It will page that user to join you. If you 
have been paged to join someone in a private chat hit P from the Chat Menu and 
you will be placed in private chat with the user who paged you. Once in a 
private chat session hit / to acces the Chat Command mode (see Chat Command 
prompt). All Chat commands are available from within Private Node to Node Chat 
except /P and /#. An additional command, /E,  is available to toggle local echo 
off and on so you can invoke split screen chat with your terminal program. For 
example, with Telix, split screen chat is ALT-Y.


Chat Command Prompt (/ from within chat)
----------------------------------------
	
	?	Display Chat Command Menu
	P	Page another user to chat
	#	Change channel (where # is the number of the channel)
	L	List node activity 
	E	Toggle local echo off/on (private node to node chat only)
	Q	Quit chat session 
	
	Ctrl-U	List users online
	Ctrl-P	Send private message to another user online


Page User to Chat (multinode chat only)		
-----------------------------------------
Enter P from the chat command prompt to page another user online to chat. The 
targeted user will receive a brief message requesting they join you in 
multinode chat. 


Change Channel (multinode chat only) 	
--------------------------------------
You can see what channel you and others are in by listing users, Ctrl-U. If you 
wish to change to a different channel enter the channel number at the chat 
command prompt. If there are no other users in the channel you will be prompted 
to password protect the channel. By password protecting a channel you can 
create a "private" chat session. Anyone entering a password protected channel 
will be prompted to enter the password upon joining the channel. If you 
password protect a channel be sure to send the password to the users you wish 
to join the channel. Only the first user in the channel has the option of 
password protecting the channel. The password protection is lifted after the 
user who protected the channel leaves. The number of channels available to you 
is determined by the sysop.

Text File Section
=================

The BBS may contain text files available for you to read online. These files 
may be anything from BBS rules to special interest information to ANSI art. To 
enter the Text File Section hit G from the Main prompt. The system will display 
a list of text file areas. These are groups of related text files. Select an 
area and a list of files contained in that text file area will be displayed or

File Transfer Section
=====================

The Synchronet File Transfer section is entered from the Main prompt by hitting 
T. To return to the Main prompt from the File Transfer prompt hit Q. The File 
Transfer section is organized in the same manner as the Message area; a 
bi-level hierarchal system with groups and sub groups. In the case of the File 
Transfer section there are libraries and directories. Libraries are groups of 
related  directories. 
Libraries might be organized such as Shareware, Graphics, etc. The Shareware 
library, for example, may contain directories such as Windows, Business, 
Utilities, etc. 
The File Transfer prompt identifies your current library and directory. The 
first name and number is your current Library. The second name and number is 
your current directory. ? will display the Main Menu. 

Library and Directory Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are two ways to select libraries and directories. You can jump to the 
library and directory #'s directly or you can jump through the libraries and 
directories sequentially until you reach the desired selection. If you wish to 
jump to the library and directory #'s directly you may want to view a list of 
libraries and directories first. From the File Transfer prompt enter:

	*	to list all available directories in your current library
	/*	to list all available libraries

	#	to jump to a new directory (where # is the directory number)
	/#	to jump to a new library (where # is the library number)

	} 	to jump forward to the next directory
	{	to jump backward to the previous directory

	]	to jump forward to the next library
	[	to jump backward to the previous library


Wildcards
~~~~~~~~~
Many commands in the File Transfer section accept wildcards. Wildcards allow 
you to search for or list a specific file or files based on part of a filename. 
Wildcard syntax is entered by typing part of the filename in conjunction with 
wildcard characters. * will wild the remainder of a filename and/or the 
remainder of an extension and ? will wild specific character positions. No 
extension after the filename will wild the entire extension. <CR> for the 
entire filename will wild the entire filename and select/list all files. When 
wildcards are accepted the prompt will appear as follows Filespec [*.*]. Some 
examples of wildcard uses are:

Filespec [*.*]:	FONT?.ZIP	=	FONT1.ZIP or FONT2.ZIP	not FONTMAN.ZIP 
Filespec [*.*]:	FONT*.ZIP	=	FONTMAN.ZIP or FONT1.ZIP	not LANMAN.ZIP
Filespec [*.*]:	FONTMAN.Z*	=	FONTMAN.ZIP or FONTMAN.ZOO	not FONTMAN.GIF
Filespec [*.*]:	<CR>	=	all files 
Filespec [*.*]:	FONTMAN	=	FONTMAN.ZIP or FONTMAN.GIF

not be available on all systems. Now see Upload Procedures.


Upload Procedures:
------------------
You now may be asked if the file is part of a multiple file set. If the file is 
not a part of a set (1 of 3 for example) then hit <CR> or N. You may now be 
asked to rate the file based on its contents. Next you will be prompted to 
enter the one line file description as you wish it to appear in the file 
listing. Then you may be asked to enter an extended description. If you do not 
wish to enter an extended description hit <CR> or N. When entering an extended 
description all Synchronet editor commands are available to you (see Synchronet 
Message Editor) in the description unless you have selected another (external) 
editor as your default editor. /S will save your description when you are 
finished.

After the extended description you will be prompted with upload options. The 
upload options are:

	protocol	Upload file with selected protocol (usually X, Y, Z, or G).
 	B	Add file to Batch Upload queue (except user to user).
	Q	Quit to File Transfer prompt and abort search.


Remove / Edit File (R)
----------------------
To remove any file or edit the description or extended description of any file 
you have uploaded on to the BBS hit R from the File Transfer prompt.



Batch File Transfers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can make uploading and or downloading multiple files much easier by using 
batch file transfers. In batch file transfers you have two queues (like holding 
tanks) in which to store files to be transferred. The upload queue holds files 
to be uploaded and the download queue holds files to be downloaded. To place 
files into the queues use the standard upload and download commands from the 
File Transfer prompt but select B for batch instead of a protocol when prompted 
with upload or download options. The upload and download commands that accept 
batch transfers are D, U, /D, and Z. The maximum number of files you may store 
in your batch queues is determined by the sysop.  

An additional option available with batch file transfers is bidirectional file 
transfers. Bidirectional file transfers allow you to upload and download files 
simultaneously in the same amount of time it takes to upload or download in one 
direction. Using bidirectional file transfers you can optimize your time online 
by virtually doubling your file transfer speed if you are uploading and 
downloading. To use bidirectional file transfers your communications software 
must either support bidirectional protocols directly or allow you to add them 
as external protocols. Currently the two most popular bidirectional protocols 
are Bimodem and HS/Link. All modems should support bidirectional file transfers 
without any problem except for US Robotics HST modems in high speed modes. 
These modems are designed to send high-speed in one direction and 450bps in the 
other simultaneously. You will not benefit from bidirectional file transfers 
with this modem at high-speed. If you have a US Robotics Dual Standard modem 
make sure you are calling in the v.32 or v.32bis mode to utilize bidirectional 
file transfers.


Batch/Bidirectional Commands (B)
--------------------------------
To use Batch/Bidirectional commands hit B from the File Transfer prompt. If you 
have no files in either your upload or download queues you will not be able to 
use Batch/Bidirectional commands until you add at least one file to one of your 
queues. Only protocols supporting batch uploads and downloads will be available 
from these commands. Xmodem for example will not be an option. The 
Batch/Bidirectional commands are:

	B	Start a bidirectional file transfer
	U	Upload files from upload queue
	D	Download files from download queue
 	L	List files in Upload and Download queues
	R	Remove a file or files from Upload or Download queues
	C	Clear (remove all) files from Upload or Download queues
	Q	Quit to File Transfer prompt



File Extraction / Temp Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If implemented on the BBS, file extraction allows you to extract files from an 
archived file (ZIP, ARC, LZH, etc.) and download only the file or files you 
need from that archive. This can be extremely helpful if you need only one 50k 
file from a 1MB ZIP file online. 

You can even extract files from nested archives. For example if an archive 
called FONTMAN.ZIP contained two archives within itself, BLUE.ZIP and RED.ZIP 
and BLUE.ZIP contained two files called FILE1.FON and FILE2.FON you would be 
able to download just the file FILE1.FON if that were the only file you needed.

All file extraction is done in your Temp Directory. This is an area you may 
extract files to and download from. You may work on one original archive at a 
time in the Temp Directory. The Temp Directory may, however, contain many files 
extracted from the original archive.  

The Temp Directory is also used to create and download a new file scan list or 
a complete list of all files on the BBS.


Temp Directory Commands (T)
---------------------------
Hit T from the File Transfer prompt to access the Temp Directory prompt. From 
this prompt the following commands are available:

	E	Extract files from an archive into the Temp Directory
	N	Create a New Files list
	F	Create a list of all files on the BBS
	A	Add or create a Temp File 
	D	Download a Temp File
	I	Information on files
	V	View the contents of any archive located in Temp Directory		L	List all files 
in the Temp Directory
	X	Extract from an archive located in Temp Directory
	R	Remove file or files from Temp Directory
	Q	Quit to File Transfer prompt

1) Extract from archive in Temp Directory
-----------------------------------------
To extract files from an archive into the Temp Directory hit E from the Temp 
Directory prompt. Enter the filename you wish to extract from. You may use a 
wildcard. 


2) Add files to Temp file
-------------------------
To download from the Temp Directory you must first create a Temp File 
containing any files you wish to download from the Temp Directory. To create a 
Temp File or add to a Temp File select A from the Temp Directory prompt. You 
can view the contents on any archives located in the Temp Directory by 
selecting V from the Temp Directory prompt. If you wish to extract files from a 
nested archive located in the Temp Directory select X. 


3) Download Temp file
---------------------
When your Temp File contains all the files you wish to download select D from 
the Temp Directory prompt to download the Temp File.


Creating and downloading file lists 
------------------------------------
Entering N from the Temp Directory prompt will create a file listing of all new 
file uploads called NEWFILES.TXT, and place the file in the Temp Directory. To 
download the file hit A to create a Temp File then D to download the Temp File. 
The list is a standard ASCII text file and can be read from any standard text 
editor or wordprocessor. Remember that creating this file in the Temp Directory 
will delete any files that are already in the directory. 

To create and download a complete file list of all files on the BBS hit F from 
the Temp Directory prompt. This will create a file called FILELIST.TXT. Then 
hit A to create a Temp File then D to download the Temp File. Again, creating 
the FILELIST.TXT will erase all existing files in the Temp Directory.
