<h2><u>[16.0] - Troubleshooting</u></h2>
<pre>Before contacting Digital Dynamics about any problems you encounter, you
should check to see if your problem is listed here, as well as do a review of
the manual.

If you are having problems with a program which is external to Synchronet
(e.g. doors, add-ons, memory managers, multi-taskers, mail tossers, front-end
mailers, hardware, etc.) you should contact the manufacturer of that
particular product.

If all else fails, and you must call Digital Dynamics for help in solving
your problem, be sure that:

        1) You are at your BBS machine.
        2) You can duplicate the problem.

<b>Problem :</b> <i>Ymodem-G doesn't work.</i>

<b>Solution:</b> Synchronet is distributed with an unregistered shareware copy of
	  DSZ.COM to allow the beginning to sysop to start out with the three
	  basic protocols, Xmodem, Ymodem, and Zmodem. To use Ymodem-G, you
	  must use a registered copy of DSZ.COM (or EXE).
	  See DSZ.DOC for more information on registering DSZ.


<b>Problem :</b> <i>Can't create QWK packets or temporary archive files.
</i>
<b>Solution:</b> Synchronet comes configured for PKZIP as the temporary file (and QWK
	  packet) compression method. In order for this to function correctly,
	  you must have a copy of PKZIP.EXE in your SBBS\EXEC directory, or
	  change the Temporary Archive Command Line to exclude the '%!'
	  specifier (short hand for the exec directory), or specify the
	  directory where PKZIP.EXE resides. See Configuration Reference for
	  more information.


<b>Problem :</b> <i>Can't view ZIP files online and can't upload files because they fail
	  the ZIP integrity test. Can't extract QWK REP packets.</i>

<b>Solution:</b> You must copy PKUNZIP.EXE into your SBBS\EXEC directory, or change
	  the command lines to reflect the actual location of PKUNZIP.EXE.
	  See Configuration Reference for more information.

<b>Problem :</b> <i>HS/Link and BiModem don't work. &quot;Bad command or filename&quot; is
	  displayed when a user tries to use them.</i>

<b>Solution:</b> You need to copy HSLINK.EXE and BIMODEM.COM into your SBBS\EXEC
	  directory. BiModem must have a BIMODEM.CFG file in each node
	  directory. Run BICONFIG to create/change the configuration
	  information stored in BIMODEM.CFG. Refer to the BiModem documentation
	  for more information on this file and using BICONFIG. One important
	  note for BiModem configuration is that &quot;Allow remote file requests&quot;
	  be set to &quot;NO&quot;.


<b>Problem :</b> <i>Get a &quot;Removing&quot; file error when starting up SBBS, at logon, and at
	  logoff sometimes when another node is active.</i>

<b>Solution:</b> You have more than one node using the same directory as the temp
	  directory. You must have a unique temp directory for each node.
	  Configure a unique temp directory for each node in the config program
	  (type SCFG from the node directory or hit 'C' at the wait for call
	  screen). See Configuration Reference for more information.


<b>Problem :</b> <i>When answering calls, Synchronet displays &quot;Unknown result code: xx&quot;
	  where xx is a decimal number, and hangs up on the caller.
</i>
<b>Solution:</b> Add this result code to your node's result code list in the config
	  program (type SCFG from the node directory or hit 'C' at the wait for
	  call screen). DO NOT add result codes 0, 2, 3, or 4. Refer to your
	  modem's manual for the connect speed and average transfer CPS for the
	  new result code. See Configuration Reference for more information.


<b>Problem :</b> <i>When using the ;DOS sysop command, the cursor position does not
	  follow your keystrokes properly.
</i>
<b>Solution:</b> Remove DOSKEY or other DOS command line TSR program from memory. Many
	  DOS command line utilities redirect DOS output to the BIOS - which in
	  turn bypasses Synchronet's interception of the DOS output functions.
	  Some ANSI drivers may also cause this problem. Use the standard DOS
	  ANSI.SYS for your console driver.


<b>Problem :</b> <i>When running external programs under OS/2 that require intercepted
	  I/O to be displayed remotely (like PKZIP, Synchronet Blackjack,
	  FEdit, etc) the output does not appear at all remotely and ANSI
	  escape sequences display as garbage.
</i>
<b>Solution:</b> OS/2's DOS console driver has a DOS compatibility bug. Run
	  SVDMANSI.COM (from the EXEC directory) and remove ANSI.SYS from your
	  CONFIG.SYS and DOS settings. See SVDMANSI.DOC for more information.


<b>Problem :</b> <i>At the WFC screen, Synchronet shows that a node has errors, and I
	  can't get them to stop showing.</i>

<b>Solution:</b> You must log on to the BBS, and at the main menu prompt type ;ERR,
	  the errors will be displayed to you, and you will be asked if you
	  want to clear the critical error counter, answer YES to clear the
	  errors.
	  You may also clear the errors using the Synchronet node utility, by
	  typing NODE ERRORS=0 at the DOS prompt.


<b>Problem :</b> <i>One of the BBS nodes will run fine, and then after one or two callers
	  the modem won't reinitialize (Synchronet returns NO RESPONSE).
</i>
<b>Solution:</b> Be sure that the com port on that node is NOT using the same IRQ or
	  I/O address as any other com port or device in your computer.  Some
	  motherboards have com ports built onto the board itself, if your
	  motherboard is like this, and you are not using those ports, you
	  should make sure they are disabled.


<b>Problem :</b> <i>My users see garbage when Synchronet runs from my front-end mailer,
	  or when they run an external door.</i>

<b>Solution:</b> Check to make sure that the DTE rate that you have set in your front
	  end mailer or door matches what you have configured for Synchronet.
	  If you are using a FOSSIL driver, the DTE rate you have set up for
	  the FOSSIL must be the same as what you have set up for Synchronet
	  (e.g. if your FOSSIL rate is locked at 38400, then that Synchronet
	  node must have its port locked at 38400).


<b>Problem :</b> <i>I am running a program as a door that was not written to be a BBS
	  door.  It functions fine locally, but when someone runs the program
	  remotely their screen remains blank.</i>

<b>Solution:</b> Make sure you have set 'Intercept I/O' turned on for that program,
	  if there is still nothing displayed to the user, it's likely that
	  the program uses direct screen writes, which would require the use
	  of a doorway program for it to be usable via modem.  If the program
	  uses graphics, it is most likely that you will not be able to use it
	  remotely.


<b>Problem :</b> <i>When posting a message or sending email, the BBS immediately responds
	  with 'ABORTED' right after I enter a title for the message.</i>

<b>Solution:</b> You have an external editor defined, and that editor is not working
	  properly.  A couple of reasons an external editor may not function
	  properly is either not enough memory available for it to run, or
	  you have used an improper command line for that editor.


<b>Problem :</b> <i>I am trying to add another BBS node using DesqView, when I try to
	  open another window for that node, I get the message 'A Non-Swappable
	  Window is in the Way'.</i>

<b>Solution:</b> You do not have enough memory available on this machine for another
	  window to be opened. You should attempt to make more EMS available.


<b>Problem :</b> <i>I am running under Windows, when the board runs it says 'Share
	  Installed' but it then says 'File Locking Failed'.</i>

<b>Solution:</b> You MUST run share from the DOS prompt BEFORE running Windows.


<b>Problem :</b> <i>I am receiving sharing violations while Synchronet is running.
</i>
<b>Solution:</b> Disable 'Swap to XMS' in the advanced settings for each node using
	  the SCFG program.


<b>Problem :</b> <i>I am receiving errors with an action of &quot;opening&quot; and a doserr
	  of 04h (as shown in the ERROR.LOG).</i>

<b>Solution:</b> You need to increase the number on the FILES= statement in your
	  CONFIG.SYS. FILES=20 should be plenty for Synchronet.


<b>Problem :</b> <i>I (or a co-sysop) lost carrier while shelled to DOS remotely and
	  the BBS didn't return to waiting for a call.</i>

<b>Solution:</b> Create two batch files (2.BAT and 3.BAT) in a directory that is
	  in your DOS search path with one line containing the word &quot;EXIT&quot;.


<b>Problem :</b> <i>When typing ;DOS, ;SLOG, or ;NLOG from the main menu I get &quot;Incorrect
	  DOS version&quot; or nothing at all.
</i>
<b>Solution:</b> Make sure the COMMAND.COM for the version of DOS you are running is
	  in your DOS search path. If multiple copies of COMMAND.COM exist on
	  your disk drive, make sure they are all for the same version.</pre>
