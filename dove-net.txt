DOVE-Net Introduction and Instructions 12/08/00, Updated 03/06/02
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Q. What is DOVE-Net?

A. DOVE-Net is a message network connecting numerous BBSes and the users on
   those BBSes together through QWK and Fido networking technologies. DOVE-Net
   consists of primarily Synchronet {tm} BBSes. This is due to the fact that
   the co-founders of DOVE-Net are also the developers of Synchronet BBS
   software. DOVE-Net is not limited to one specific BBS package and welcomes
   any QWK or Fido network compatible BBS to join as long as their software of
   choice does not interfere with the operation of the network in any way.


Q. Why the name DOVE-Net?

A. Two BBSes began DOVE-Net back in 1989. These BBSes were Vertrauen (Home
   of Synchronet BBS Software) and The Beast's Domain (Home of Domain
   Entertainment BBS Add-ons). The word DOVE came from DOmain VErtrauen,
   much like the word MODEM came from MOdulator DEModulator. It has nothing
   to do with that species of bird or the symbolism of peace, but we have
   nothing against those things either. It was a small network that needed
   a small name.


Q. What is the focus of DOVE-Net?

A. Connecting BBS sysops and users without a lot of politics and red tape.
   DOVE-Net requires no "application processing time" or "node numbers" to
   be assigned. While the capabilities of DOVE-Net rival those of more
   technically complex networks, it has none of the setup complexities as
   reflected by the fact that many of the systems on DOVE-Net are managed by
   first-time sysops. DOVE-Net allows (or rather encourages) the use of color
   codes in messages (preferably using the Synchronet Ctrl-A standard, but
   Wildcat, PCBoard, Celerity, Renegade, and WWIV color codes are also
   supported in Synchronet BBS software and may also be used). DOVE-Net allows
   the use of aliases, ANSI encoded messages (when necessary for animation)
   and use of high-ASCII characters. There are no strict "hubbing" rules;
   pretty much anyone that's willing to feed anyone else is encouraged to do
   so. DOVE-Net is moderated only by the founders of the network so there
   aren't different rules for different message areas that users need to
   remember. Private messages are allowed, but when possible, routed NetMail
   is preferred. DOVE-Net has very few rules, and the few that do exist are
   often bent.


Instructions
============

Synchronet BBS Software for Win32 v3.00 comes pre-configured for DOVE-Net 
using the Windows command-line FTP client application to transfer packets 
with Vetrauen (vert.synchro.net). All you need to do is follow the 
instructions in the pre-installed file: EXEC\VERT.BAT.

*** FTP Caveat ***
Normal FTP transfers require a separate data session back to your system. 
This is normally handled automatically by the FTP software, but if your 
system is behind a firewall, proxy server, or other gateway that does not 
support normal (non-passive) FTP sessions, the FTP file transfers will fail. 
You will need to either enable normal FTP support in your gateway system, 
switch to a different FTP client application (e.g. WS_FTP) that supports 
passive (PASV) mode, or use a scripted telnet client as an alternative method 
of transferring packets.

If you're a Synchronet sysop using an older version of Synchronet, consult 
the step-by-step instructions in the QWK networking chapter of your sysop 
manual, but use the updated conference numbers at the end of this document. 
Additionally, if you're going to use Vertrauen (VERT) as your hub, then 
you'll need to connect using a scripted Telnet or FTP client (details follow).

*** IMPORTANT ***
When you create your QWKnet account on your hub BBS, you MUST use your BBS's
QWK ID for the user name. QWK IDs are a maximum of eight characters, may
only contain valid DOS filename characters, and MUST begin with an alphabetic
character. QWK IDs are not case sensitive. Your QWK ID should be an 
abbreviation of your BBS name or something relevant to you or your BBS and it 
must be unique among the names in the enclosed NODES.DAT file. Note: If you're 
using Vertrauen as a hub, you must login (to vert.synchro.net) with a Telnet 
client to create your account.


Using a Scripted Telnet Client for QWKnet Transfers
---------------------------------------------------
Any Telnet client that supports scripting should work. I've included a script
for ZOC (Telnet client for Windows and OS/2) written by PistolGrip
(sysop@wasteland.darktech.org). This script and instructions on how to use it
are included in ZOCQWK11.ZIP.


Using a Scripted FTP Client for QWKnet Transfers
------------------------------------------------
Your hub must be running a Synchronet v3 FTP Server for you to use FTP for
QWKnet transfers. If you're using Vertrauen as your hub, the FTP address is
ftp://vert.synchro.net. To use the command-line FTP client that comes with
Windows, follow these steps (ignore these instructions if you've installed 
Synchronet v3.00b or later):

1. Edit the enclosed VERT.BAT file to reflect the correct location of your
   Synchronet DATA directory. If you using a hub other than Vertrauen, change
   the filenames to reflect your hub's QWK ID.

2. Edit the enclosed VERT.FTP file to reflect your system's QWK ID, the
   password you used for your QWKnet account, and the correct location of your
   Synchronet DATA directory.

3. Copy VERT.BAT and VERT.FTP to your Synchronet EXEC directory.

4. Change your QWKnet call-out command line to "%!VERT.BAT".


Using the Baja FTP Client for QWKnet Transfers (Requires Synchronet v3.1+)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the preferred method of QWKnet packet transfers.

1. Make sure you have the file QNET-FTP.BIN in your EXEC directory.

2. Change the QWKnet call-out command line (in SCFG->Networks->QWK->Hubs->VERT)
   to "*QNET-FTP VERT vert.synchro.net YOURPASS" but replace YOURPASS with the
   password you used when creating your QWKnet user account on Vertrauen.


Terminology (as used in this document)
--------------------------------------

Hub:		A BBS that feeds another BBS messages for a message network
Node:		A BBS that calls another BBS to exchange messages for a network
		A BBS can be (and most often is) either "both a node and a hub"
		or "only a node", if you're joining DOVE-Net for the first time,
                then your system will be "only a node".
QWK:		Message packet format used for off-line mail readers
QWKnet: 	Message networking technology using QWK packets
Fido:		Message networking technology based on Fido BBS software
FidoNet:	The single largest amateur message network on earth
Echo:		Message area that is connected to multiple BBSes via message
		network
NetMail:	Private message between one user and another not stored in a
		topical message area (echo), similar in princicple to Internet 
		e-mail
SMB:		Synchronet Message Base format, download SMB_*.ZIP from Vertrauen
		for technical specification and C library


QWK Technical Notes
-------------------

Non-Synchronet systems importing DOVE-Net messages may notice some things about
the messages which are different from other BBS packages. The first line of
each message may contain "@VIA:" and a list of DOVE-Net BBS ID's the message
has passed through, each separated by a slash character. This line is used to
automatically create and maintain the Synchronet ROUTE.DAT "map" file as well 
as detect circular message paths (dupe loops). The first or second line of each
message may contain "@TZ:" and a four character hexadecimal number. This is the
time zone (as defined in the SMB specification) of the BBS that the message was
originally posted on. These Synchronet-specific QWK features can be disabled
from the online QWK: menu. Note, if Ctrl-A codes are enabled, the @VIA/@TZ
lines are automatically enabled for QWKnet nodes as well. So to disable the 
@VIA/@TZ lines, you must also disable (strip) Ctrl-A codes.

Messages exported from Synchronet may also contain Synchronet Ctrl-A color
codes. These can be disabled for any hubs you're calling in SCFG (Synchronet
Configuration Program) or if the other BBS is calling you, then they can
disable them by sending a message to "SBBS" with a title of "CTRL-A STRIP".

The following control messages are supported by Synchronet for QWK networking.
The message must be posted to "SBBS" from the node BBS:

Subj: DROP [conf#]
Note: Drop current conference (or specified conference #) from future packets

Subj: ADD [ptr | -msgs | mm/dd/yy]
Note: Add current conference to future packets and optionally set message ptr

Subj: RESET [ptr | -msgs | mm/dd/yy]
Note: Set message pointer for current conference, - indicates offset from last

Subj: RESETALL [ptr | -msgs | mm/dd/yy]
Note: Set message pointers for all conferences

Subj: FREQ <filename>
Note: File Request from file transfer database (not attachments)

Subj: FILES [ON | OFF | mm/dd/yy]
Note: Include files list in packet and/or specify new-scan date

Subj: ATTACH [ON | OFF]
Note: Include file attachments in packet automatically (e-mail only)

Subj: CTRL-A [KEEP | EXPAND | STRIP]
Note: Ctrl-A color/attribute codes - leave-in, expand to ANSI, or remove

Subj: TZ [ON | OFF]
Note: Include time-zone (@TZ) lines in exported messages

Subj: VIA [ON | OFF]
Note: Include path (@VIA) lines in exported messages

Subj: NDX [ON | OFF]
Note: Include index (.NDX) files

Subj: CONTROL [ON | OFF]
Note: Include extraneous control files (CONTROL.DAT, DOOR.ID, NETFLAGS.DAT)
