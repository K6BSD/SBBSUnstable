Synchronet Console Documentation
================================

Introduction
------------
The Synchronet Console is the console-mode sysop interface to Synchronet v3.
On Win32 operating systems, this interface (sbbs.exe) is an alternative to 
the graphical Synchronet Control Panel (sbbsctrl.exe). On Unix, this interface
(sbbs) is currently the only option.

On Win32 operating systems, the exact same underlying server libraries (DLLs)
are used to service the clients, so from the users perspective there should
be no difference in performance or functionality. The console mode interface
does use fewer system resources than the graphical control panel, so for some
sysops that wish to conserve system resources, this may be the preferred
interface.


BBS Configuration
-----------------
The system-wide configuration files (ctrl/*.cnf) are edited using the
Synchronet configuration utility (SCFG). The executable filename is 
exec/scfg.exe on Win32 and exec/scfg on Unix.

SCFG needs to be told the location of your Synchronet ctrl directory, where
it expects to find the Synchronet configuration (.cnf) files. This can be done
by passing the path to your ctrl directory on the SCFG command line, example:

	scfg /sbbs/ctrl

or by setting the SBBSCTRL environment variable before running SCFG. Example:

Unix:	export SBBSCTRL=/sbbs/ctrl
Win32:	set SBBSCTRL=/sbbs/ctrl

Many of the Synchronet utilities require this environment variable, so it is
suggested you initialize this environment variable in your system startup 
and/or login scripts.

The SCFG application supports multiple forms of user interface. The default
interface is currently curses/conio (full-screen colored text). To use a
different interface, use the -G (graphical) or -D (stdio) command-line
options. There are other command-line options to control the character set
used, escape key delay, monochrome/color mode, etc. Type "scfg -?" to list
all the available command-line options.

There are other system-configuration files that are simple text files to be
edited using any ASCII text editor: ctrl/*.cfg and text/*.can. Each of
these files should contain a description of its purpose and usage.


Server Configuration
--------------------
The server/host-specific configuration options are set with sbbs command-line
options (run "sbbs help" for a list), or by editing the Synchronet
Initialization file (e.g. ctrl/sbbs.ini).


Initialization File
-------------------
The default initalization file is ctrl/sbbs.ini. A different initialization 
(.ini) filename may be used by specifying the path and filename on the sbbs
command-line. Example:

	sbbs /sbbs/ctrl/mybbs.ini

If the path and filename of the initialization file is not passed on the
command-line, sbbs will use the SBBSCTRL environment variable to determine
the location of your Synchronet ctrl directory, where it expects to find
either <HOSTNAME>.ini or sbbs.ini.


Running Synchronet
------------------
If you've initialized the SBBSCTRL environment variable and edited your BBS
and server configuration, you are now ready to run Synchronet. You can do
this by simply running exec/sbbs (off of the installation directory).
