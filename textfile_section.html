<h2><u>[13.0] - </u><a name="Text File Sections"><u>Text File Sections</u></a></h2>
<pre>Run the SCFG utility, and select the Text File Sections option from the menu.
This selection will produce a list of text file sections that the sysop has
created for users to freely view text files. It is requested that all sysops
make some or all of the Synchronet documentation available in a text file
section. At the very minimum, TEXT\SBBS.MSG should be available for users to
review. You can add and remove sections with the INS and DEL keys. The
following configuration options are available for each section:</pre>
<h2><u>[13.1] - <a name="Text File Options">Text File Options</a></u></h2>
<pre><b>Name:</b>
        This is a description of the text file section.

<b>Access Requirements:
</b>        Use this option to set the security requirements to access this file
        section.

<b>Internal Code:
</b>        This is an internal code for SBBS to distinguish this text file section
        from the others on the system. This must be a unique name of up to 8
        valid DOS filename characters.</pre>
<h2><u>[13.2] - <a name="Adding Text Files">Adding Text Files</a></u></h2>
<pre>To add files to a text file section, you'll need to log on to the BBS and enter
the section you would like to add files to.  Here you'll be given a choice to
add files to the section, you will be prompted for the title of the file, and
the path/filename. If you do not enter a path for the file, the default path is
the Synchronet DATA\TEXT directory PLUS the internal code of the text file
section.</pre>
<h2><u>[13.3] - </u><a name="976/900 Number Billing"><u>976/900 Number Billing</u></a></h2>
<pre>There are several methods of implementing 976/900 billing support.

One method, which is internal to Synchronet, is to set up a billing node.
This method of support requires that you have your own in house 976 or 900
phone number.  Set up your 976/900 service to bill a lump sum of money
(e.g. $10.00) after the first 30 seconds of use. In SCFG, under Nodes-&gt;Node#-&gt;
Advanced Options-&gt;Cost per Call you would enter this charge (where Node# is the
number of the node which will be attached to the 976/900 line). When a user
calls this billing node, he/she will be informed that they will be charged for
the call if they do not hang up, they will then be asked for their user name
and password.  Once they've entered their account information, the account will
be credited with a number of credits (determined by the value in System-&gt;
Advanced Options-&gt;Credits per Dollar). They can now call back on a node which
is connected to a standard phone line, and they will be able to make use of the
credits.

Another method, which is cheaper and more popular, but external to Synchronet
is to use a third party 976/900 service. Once such service is called TABS. This
method consists of having your users dial a 976/900 line supplied by the
service. Initially, you are given an external program and a list of codes for
your BBS. When a user calls the 976/900 service they will be given a code to
use on your BBS. They then call your BBS, run the external program, and enter
the code that they were given. Upon entering a valid code, their account is
immediately credited with a number of credits. You are then periodically mailed
a check for the accounts which have used the service for account upgrades.

The final method, which is very expensive and very unrealistic, is to simply
attach all of your pay nodes to a 976/900 number and charge the user by the
minute for access to the BBS.</pre>
