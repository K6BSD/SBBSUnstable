This update of Synchronet includes a new feature: internal Telnet gateway

This allows users on your system to be connected to other TCP/Telnet services
on the Internet through your BBS. Typically, these services would be other
telnetable BBSs and MUDs, although really, you can gate to any single-port
TCP service (i.e. POP3, but not FTP).

The updated BAJA.EXE and SBBS.DLL support a new Baja function:

TELNET_GATE <"str" || str_var> [mode]

The str or str_var argument is the destination address in the format:

	<addr>[:port]

If port is not specified, the default is 23 (telnet).

Examples:

	"vert.sync3.net"
	"24.0.193.46"
	"retromud.org:3000"

The valid mode bits are:

	Force Echo	.1	# not currently working as desired
	Force CR/LF	.2	# expand sole CRs to CR/LF pairs

This function can be called from any module or shell, but will most likely be
used from the external programs menu (even though the telnet gate isn't
technically an external program). Two modules are included, TELGATE.BIN and
MUDGATE.BIN, to achieve this (copy them into your EXEC directory). Use them as
follows:

	To set-up an external gateway to another BBS:

	Command line: "*telgate vert.sync3.net"

	To set-up an external gateway to a MUD:

	Command line: "*mudgate batmud.bat.org"

While using the telgate gateway (and not currently in telnet "Binary" mode),
users can press ctrl-] for a menu of telgate commands including: Disconnect,
Toggle Echo, List Users, and Private Message.
