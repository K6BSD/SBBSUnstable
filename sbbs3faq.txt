Q: Is Synchronet going to continue to be freeware?
A: Yes, I'm just doing this for fun (what a sicko!).
   * See http://synchro.net/copyright.html for details.

Q: What operating system does Synchronet Version 3.0 run on?
A: Synchronet v3 is currently a Win32 application designed for use on Windows 
   95/98/NT4/2000.
   * Windows XP is supported too.
   * Synchronet v3.10 also runs on Linux and FreeBSD operating systems.

Q: Is v3 multi-user/multi-threaded?
A: Yes, all nodes are (typically) run in the same process/window.
   External programs, however, run in their own processes/windows.
   Version 2.3 for OS/2 was also multi-threaded, but not multi-user: each node 
   ran in its own process/window.

Q: Is there going to be a DOS version of v3?
A: No, but I did release an update to v2 for DOS/OS2 (2.30c). This update
   included some of the Y2K fixes I've made in v3 and some other minor
   additions, fixes, and features.

Q: Is there going to be an OS/2 version of v3?
A: Possible, but not probable.

Q: Is there going to be a Linux version of v3?
A: Definitely.
   * The Linux version is currently distributed in source code form only,
     see http://synchro.net/source.html for details.

Q: Can I mix v2 and v3 nodes on the same BBS?
A: Yes, all of the configuration and data files were purposely kept backwards 
   compatible.
   * As of v3.10, there are additional "issues" that must be addressed when mixing
     v2 and v3.1 nodes (mainly in regards to the TEXT.DAT and exec/*.BIN files).

Q: Can I mix v2 and v3 nodes on the same computer?
A: Yes.

Q: Does v3 still support traditional dial-in users?
A: No, v3 is a telnet-only BBS program. Use v2 nodes for your dial-in users.

Q: Do I need a Telnet/FOSSIL application (e.g. NetModem or COM/IP) for v3 
   nodes?
A: No, Synchronet v3 includes a DOS/FOSSIL interrupt driver (dynamically loaded
   VXD for Windows 95/98 and VDD for Windows NT/2000).

Q: Is v3 Y2K compatible?
A: Yes.

Q: Is the source code for Synchronet v3 available?
A: * The source code has been available since October, 2000. 
     See http://synchro.net/source.html for details.

Q: How many v3 nodes can I run on one machine?
A: Theoretically, 250. If your BBS uses external DOS programs for file 
   transfers and/or doors, then the realistic number is much lower depending on
   bandwidth and horsepower (DOS programs consume more system resources than
   native 32-bit programs). 

Q: Can I spread my nodes across two or more machines?
A: Yes, v3 includes a configuration dialog that lets you specify a range of 
   nodes to support in that instance.

Q: Are there limitations to v3?
A: Yes:
	o No direct dial-in support (Telnet only)
	o Only externals programs that use DOS interrupts (XSDK/WWIV doors) or 
          FOSSIL for I/O will work with v3.
          * 32-bit doors that use TCP Sockets or Standard I/O are also supported.
	o Relative paths (e.g. "..\XTRN\BLA.EXE") are no-longer supported in 
          command lines (the current directory cannot be assumed to be the 
          current NODE directory). Relative paths ARE still supported in data 
          directories and other paths in SCFG.
	
Q: Are there benefits to v3?
A: Yes:
	o Speed, speed, speed 
		* Separate I/O threads dynamically created for each node in use
		* Direct socket communications (except when running dos 
                  externals)
		* No DOS context-switching (except when running dos externals)
		* Idle nodes (WFC) consume no resources, bandwidth, or CPU time
		* System events run in their own dedicated thread
	o Reliability
		* A crashed door shoudn't crash the entire system, or in most 
                  cases, even the current node
	o Functionality
		* User IP address and host name are logged and stored in user 
                  record
		* Optional AutoLogon via IP address
		* IP/Host name trashcan
		* Users can be ;INTERrupted while running ANY external program
		* Non-exclusive events do not take any nodes off-line
		* No memory limitations (for configuration items, message 
                  lengths, etc)
		* Integrated FTP Server: seemlessly integrated with the BBS
		  file database with long filename support and QWK transfers
		* Integrated Mail (POP3/SMTP) server supports MX-record
		  lookups, aliases, SPAM filters, are more
	o Simplicity
		* No third-party Telnet/FOSSIL driver (NetModem or COM/IP) 
                  necessary
		* Simple COM port configuration (all nodes can use COM1, for 
                  example)
		* No more hassling with baud rates and initialization strings 
                  (they're not used)
		* As many nodes as you want to run, all in the same window!
		* Eliminates all those short-cut icons and taskbar buttons!
		* DCDWATCH no longer necessary to support WWIV externals

Q: When will v3 be available?
A: It is available now. Logon to vert.synchro.net via FTP or Telnet.
