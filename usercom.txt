USER.COM Documentation
----------------------

This utility will extract the activity and statistics of a particular user from
the Synchronet detailed log files.

usage: user <username> <logfiles>

'username' is the name or number of the user whose doings should be extracted.
           It should be placed in double quotes if the name is more than one
           word, and is case sensitive.
'logfiles' is a log filename or list of log files to search (wildcards are ok)

It is useful to redirect the output of USER.COM into a text file for viewing.

Examples:  user "Bill Wagstaff" c:\sbbs\data\logs\07*.log > bwag.txt
           user 0155 ..\maylogs\*.log ..\junlogs\*.log >rbar.txt
