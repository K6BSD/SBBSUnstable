Synchronet Mail Server v1.00 (beta) Documentation
=================================================

Set-up
~~~~~~
1. Set SCFG->Networks->Internet->Address to your system's Internet address 
   (domain name or static IP).

2. Set SCFG->Networks->Internet->Allow Sending of Netmail to "Yes".

3. Set SCFG->Networks->Internet->Allow File Attachments to "No"
   (File attachments from the BBS are not supported at this time).

4. Set SCFG->Networks->Internet->Send NetMail using Alias however you wish
   (Users can receive e-mail to their Alias OR real-name regardless of this
   setting).

5. Set SBBSCTRL->Mail Server->Configure->DNS Server to the address of your
   ISP's DNS server OR set Relay Server to the address of your ISP's SMTP 
   server. 


Notes
~~~~~
Users will be able to send Internet e-mail from your BBS now (if you have a 
customized TEXT.DAT make sure you have updated line 62, "InternetMailing").

Your users will be able to receive e-mail at your BBS using any of the
following ways:
	
	First.Last@your.bbs.domain	Example: digital.man@vert.sync3.net
	RealFirst.Last@your.bbs.domain	Example: rob.swindell@vert.sync3.net
	UserNumber@your.bbs.domain	Example: 1@vert.sync3.net
	"First Last"@your.bbs.domain	Example: "digital man"@vert.sync3.net
	"RealFirst Last"@you.bbs.domain	Example: "rob swindell"@vert.sync3.net

E-mail user names are not case sensitive (e.g. Digital.Man and digital.man are
both valid user names). In order for users to receive mail via usernumber, that
option must be checked in SBBSCTRL->Mail->Configure.

E-mail sent to "SYSOP", "POSTMASTER", your BBS's QWKID, or the sysop name
(as configured in SCFG) will automatically go to user #1 on the BBS.

Additional aliases can be configured by creating the text file CTRL\ALIAS.CFG
with the following syntax:

-------------------------------[ Begin ]--------------------------------------

; This is a comment
;
; Alias			User Name or number

root			sysop
sysadmin		sysop
webmaster		sysop
great.drummer		Rob Swindell

--------------------------------[ End ]---------------------------------------

If a user has their account configured to forward their e-mail to an Internet
address and they receive an Internet e-mail, it will automatically be forwarded
to the configured address.

The sysop of QWKnet nodes can receive e-mail at their QWK-ID @ their hub's
Internet domain/ip address. Example: If YOURBBS (QWK-ID) polls VERT for QWKnet,
you (the sysop) can receive e-mail at yourbbs@vert.sync3.net.

You (or any of the user's on YOURBBS) can send Internet e-mail from YOURBBS 
through VERT by sending a QWKnet NetMail message to NETMAIL@VERT with the 
actual destination Internet address as the first line of the message.


Relaying
~~~~~~~~
As of v1.10, the Synchronet Mail Server can be used to relay e-mail to external
servers. Due to the security (SPAM) risks of opening the SMTP server up to just
anyone, you must specify which hostnames or IP addresses you wish to allow to
relay mail. You do this by creating the file TEXT\RELAY.CAN and list the IP
addresses or host names of the systems you wish to give relay access to. If you
wish to allow relay access to all hosts (not recommended), simply create a 
RELAY.CAN with one line containing ".~".


Planned Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o File attachments from the BBS (MIME encoding/decoding)
o Public sub-boards sent via POP3 (as mailaing lists) and/or NNTP users
o Forwarding Internet e-mail to routed QWKnet (or possibly FidoNet) addresses
	Example: 2@YOURBBS@vert.sync3.net would automatically foward to user #2
                 at YOURBBS via QWKnet.
