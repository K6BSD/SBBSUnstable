Synchronet FTP Server v1.01 beta
================================

This version of Synchronet includes an integrated FTP Server. The FTP Server 
has the following features:

o Allows Anonymous/Guest logins (Anonymous is a psuedonym for the "Guest"
  account on your BBS - must have a BLANK password to allow anonymous logins).

o Virtual file system mimics your BBS File Libraries/Directories (following
  ARS security settings).

o Index files are (optionally) automatically generated. Use FTP Explorer
  (www.ftpx.com) to see how cool this feature can be.

o You can create your own FTP login, hello, and goodbye messages (configured
  in SBBSCTRL).

o QWK message packets can be downloaded by users and QWKnet accounts and REP
  packets uploaded.

o Sysop and Upload directories (if configured in SCFG) are supported for
  uploads, but the contents of the directories aren't visible to users with
  insufficient access (as configured in SCFG).

o New "DESC" FTP extension to allow files to be described by a user (before
  the file is uploaded). Use the "literal" or "quote" feature of your FTP
  client to utilize this feature.

o New "SITE WHO" FTP extension shows who's currently using the BBS and will
  show information about other FTP users in the future. You may need to use
  the "quote" feature of your FTP client to send this command to the FTP
  server.


FTP Filename Aliases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can create a list of file aliases that will appear in your FTP root 
directory for:

o Quick and easy access to often downloaded user files

o Static filenames that corresponds to a dynamically changing filenames
  e.g. ftp://vert.synchro.net/sbbs_for_dos.zip always points to the current
       versioned filename of Synchronet for DOS (e.g. SBBS230B.ZIP)

o Download access to files on the local disk not in the BBS file database 

How? Edit the file CTRL\FTPALIAS.CFG (SBBSCTRL->FTP->Edit->Alias List). The
format is similar to that of the Synchronet Mail Server ALIAS.CFG, one alias
per line in the format:

alias	path	description

The alias is not case-sensitive and may not contain spaces. This is the 
filename that will appear in your FTP root directory.

The path element is either the full path and filename to a file on a
local file system (e.g. C:\DOCS\MYFILE.TXT) or a virtual path to a file in the
BBS file database. Virtual paths are specified as "bbs://lib/dir/filename"
where lib is the library short name, dir is the directory internal code and
filename is the actual filename of the referenced file (may be the long
filename, but may not contain spaces). 

The description is the optional description of the file that will be used in 
the dynamically generated Auto Index file (if you have this option enabled).

Lines beginning with a ';' are considered comments and are ignored.

Example Alias:

sbbs_for_dos.zip bbs://main/sbbs/sbbs230b.zip Current version for SBBS for DOS


Sysop Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~
To login with system operator access, you must login with a user account that
has a security level of 90 or higher (user #1 usually has level 99) and enter 
your password as "pass:syspass" where pass is your personal password and 
syspass is the system password.

A successful sysop login will generate a login message stating 
"Sysop access granted". Logging in with just your personal password will give
you normal (non-sysop) access.

Sysop access allows you to mount local file systems and will enable secure
BBS database features in the future (such as deleting/renaming files).


Local File System Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a powerful new feature that allows the sysop to access any and all
locally accessible files and file systems via FTP (very convenient for
remote administration). The "Local File System" checkbox must be checked in the
FTP configuration dialog in SBBSCTRL to enable this feature.

To access local file systems, you must first login with sysop access
(see "Sysop Access" for details). Once logged in with sysop access, you may
mount the local file system. There are two ways to mount the local file system
(and subsequently to revert to the BBS file system):

SMNT (Structure Mount)
----------------------
Sysops may use the FTP "SMNT" command to mount the local files system. Since most 
FTP clients do not support the SMNT command, you'll probably need to use the 
"quote" feature of your FTP client to send the command to the FTP server. 

The syntax is "SMNT new_dir" where new_dir is the file system specifier 
for the new directory used in the FTP hierarchy. Example: "SMNT C:\" 
would make the root directory of your local C drive your new current FTP
directory (for Windows' command-line ftp, type "quote SMNT C:\").

You can access shared drives on other machines on your local area network
by using "SMNT \\othersys\drive" where othersys is the name of the other
computer and drive is the share name of the desired drive.

To switch back to (mount) the BBS file database, use "SMNT bbs:"

CD (Change Directory)
---------------------
Sysops can mount the local file system using a special case of the CD (CWD, XCWD)
command. By prefixing "local:" to the new directory, the local file system will
be automatically mounted. Example: "cd local:c:\".

Once the local file system is mounted, you can switch between drives and shared
drives with the CD command (the "local:" specifier is not needed). 
Example: "cd d:\".

To access a shared drive on other machines: "cd \\othersys\drive".

To switch back to (mount) the BBS file system, use "cd bbs:".

Since some FTP clients do not support the SMNT command, nor allow users to enter
verbatim FTP commands, the CD method is the easiest and most reliable method of
accessing the local file system.
