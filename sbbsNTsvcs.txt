Synchronet NT Services
======================

$Id$

If you're running Synchronet on a Microsoft Windows NT based operating system
(e.g. Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP, or Windows 2003), you can now run
Synchronet as a set of NT services using the exectuable sbbsNTsvcs.exe.

This single executable includes 4 NT services that handle all the functionality
of Synchronet v3.11-Win32:

Name                 Description
----                 -----------
SynchronetBBS        Synchronet Telnet/RLogin Server
SynchronetFTP        Synchronet FTP Server
SynchronetMail       Synchronet SMTP/POP3 Mail Server
SynchronetServices   Synchronet Services

You may install, disable, or remove each NT service independantly, or all at
once. To install on the Synchronet NT services at once, run:

	sbbsNTsvcs install

The configuration of the Synchronet servers and services is handled in your
Synchronet initialization file (e.g. ctrl/sbbs.ini). The Synchronet NT
services know the location of your Synchronet CTRL directory from the
SBBSCTRL environment variable. See sbbscon.txt for more details about the
SBBSCTRL environment variable and the initialization file (sbbs.ini).

Once installed, the Synchronet NT services may be started from the NT Services
dialog (under the Control Panel), by running the Synchronet Control Panel, or 
if the system is rebooted, the services will start automatically.

To remove the Synchronet NT services, run:

	sbbsNTsvcs remove

Synchronet Control Panel
------------------------
You should shutdown the Synchronet Control Panel (GUI) before installing the
Synchronet NT services. The Synchronet Control Panel can be used to start,
stop, and monitor the NT services once installed, but it is not required for
operation. If the Synchronet Control Panel is not running, the BBS servers 
will still function, even if no user is logged onto Windows.

NT Event Log
------------
Error messages (determined by the LogMask in your sbbs.ini file) will be
logged as NT application event log messages (viewable in your NT Event Viewer).
The event log messages are currently stored in an undefined format, though
you can view the text.

Beta
----
This feature (NT services) is brand new to Synchronet and it may not be as
reliable as running sbbs.exe or sbbsctrl.exe. Please report any problems
as soon as possible (see http://synchro.net/docs/support.html for contact
points of support), or e-mail rob@synchro.net.
