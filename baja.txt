Introduction
============

Baja (pronounced b„'h„) is a high-level development tool used to create
"command shells" and "loadable modules" for Synchronet BBS software. The
programmable command and menu structure (PCMS) technology in Synchronet version
2 allows sysops to modify the user interface for the BBS by replacing or
modifying command shells. Synchronet version 2.0 shipped with six stock command
shells (Classic and Novice Synchronet shells as well as emulations of PCBoard,
Wildcat, Major, and Renegade BBS packages). These shells can be modified,
removed, or replaced with ease. Up to 500 shells can be made available to the
users of the BBS with configurable security access to each shell via ARS (see
the Synchronet Sysop manual for details on ARS).

Synchronet loadable modules are used to extend or customize the abilities of
the BBS. Some modules are automatically loaded during specific events (login,
logon, logoff, etc) while others may be executed at the request of a user
(much like a door or other internal menu option).

Note:

If you come across an undefined term in this document, please read through
the document to possibly find the term defined later or used again to clarify
its meaning by context, or see the glossary in the Synchronet sysop manual.

Source Files
============

Command shells and modules begin their life as a text source file (normally
with a .SRC extension) or group of text files (including .INC files). These
source files (and .INC files) can be edited with any ASCII text editor (e.g.
EDIT, QEDIT, EDLIN, etc). The contents of the text file (often referred to as
"source code") must conform to the Baja language specifications defined in this
document. An extremely basic example of a command shell source file:

----------------------------------[ Begin ]-----------------------------------

# EXAMPLE1.SRC

# Label for later "goto" commands
:TOP

# Clear the screen
CLS

# Show menu of commands
MNEMONICS "~Comment to Sysop\r\n"
MNEMONICS "~Goodbye (Logoff)\r\n"

# Show command prompt
PRINT "\r\nCommand: "

# Get command key
GETCMD "CG"

# Comment to sysop?
COMPARE_KEY C
IF_TRUE
	SETSTR "1"
        MAIL_SEND_FEEDBACK
        GOTO TOP
        END_IF

# Logoff?
COMPARE_KEY G
IF_TRUE
        LOGOFF
        GOTO TOP
        END_IF

-----------------------------------[ End ]------------------------------------

The syntax of the above text will be explained later in this document.

For more examples of Baja source code, please see the *.SRC files in your
Synchronet EXEC directory.

BAJA.EXE
========

After the source file has been created, BAJA.EXE is used to compile the .SRC
file into a binary file with a .BIN extension that Synchronet can interpret
and execute. If the source filename is EXAMPLE1.SRC, then the command line
would be:

	BAJA EXAMPLE1

The compiler's output:

BAJA v2.00 ú Synchronet Shell/Module Compiler ú Copyright 1995 Digital Dynamics

Compiling EXAMPLE1.BIN...
Resolving labels...

Done.

This creates the binary file EXAMPLE1.BIN.

Warning: Do not attempt to edit, view, or print .BIN files.

If the compile fails, an error message will be displayed with the filename that
contains the error and the specific line number followed by a colon and the
offending code.

Baja source (.SRC), include (.INC), and binary (.BIN) files as well as the Baja
program itself are normally stored in the Synchronet EXEC directory. This is
where Synchronet loads command shells and modules from, so the .BIN files must
be created in or copied to this directory before they can be used.

After a command shell has been compiled, it must be added to the list of
available command shells in SCFG (Synchronet Configuration program) to be
available for the users to use. If using a multinode BBS, the other nodes
must be re-run before the new command shell will be available on those nodes.

If modifying an existing command shell, SCFG does not need to be run and nodes
do not have to be re-run since command shell binary files are dynamically
loaded for each logon.

Modules
=======

Baja modules are very similar to command shells with the main difference being
that they are not automatically loaded upon logon as command shells are
(with the exception of login and logon modules). Instead, modules must be
loaded from a command shell with the EXEC_BIN function described later in
this document or launched as an external program or event configured in SCFG.
Binary module files, like command shell binaries, must be located in the
Synchronet EXEC directory.

Modules can be used to consolidate identical portions of multiple command
shells into one binary that can be loaded from each command shell so that if a
modification needs to be made to that portion, then only one source file needs
to be modified and recompiled as opposed to making the same change to every
command shell and recompiling them all. An example of this use is the STR_CMDS
(string commands) module that is launched from multiple command shells.

Another use for modules is for third-party add-ons. Rather than distributing
Baja source that must be merged into command shell source by sysops, developers
can distribute module binaries that can be loaded directly from a command
shell with a very small modification to the existing shells.

To load a Baja module in place of a DOS executable in SCFG, prepend an asterisk
(*) to the name of the module (e.g. "*MYMOD") for the command line. If an
argument is included on the command line (e.g. "*MYMOD %A") the contents
will be automatically placed into the current command string for possible use
by the module or functions there in.

To load a Baja module while displaying a message, menu file, or TEXT.DAT line
(excluding lines containing % variables) use "@EXEC:MYMOD@", were MYMOD is the
name of the module to execute. This is useful for executing modules in places
where they cannot normally be loaded by event or command line. @-codes are
only expanded in posts and e-mail if posted locally by user #1 (the sysop).

Programming Syntax
==================

Basics:
        Execution always begins at the top of the source code and continues
	downward until a function is executed which changes the flow of
	execution. Only one function is allowed per line. The total length of
	each line cannot exceed 1000 characters.

Whitespace:
        All whitespace (TAB and SPACE characters) at the beginning of each line
        are ignored. The first printable character of a line is considered
        the first character. Completely blank lines are ignored.

Comments:
        If the first character of a line is the pound symbol (#), the
        line is ignored. These are normally used for text comments (remarks)
	about the following source code line(s). Comments may be included on
	the same lines as some (not all) functions, but in general it is
	considered best to keep comments on their own lines as to not interfere
	with proper Baja syntax. Comments are more easily read if there is a
	space after the pound symbol (#) and before the comment text begins.

Labels:
        If the first printable character of a line is a colon (:), the line is
	considered a label to be used for the GOTO or CALL functions. Labels
        are not case sensitive. There should be no space between the colon and
	the name of the label. Label names may not contain spaces. Duplicate
	label names within the same module or shell are disallowed.

Case Sensitivity:
	Most elements of Baja syntax are not case sensitive (where upper or
	lower case is significant). Functions, and variable names (for example)
	are not case sensitve. Character constants ('A' for example) are case
	sensitive.

Variables:
        Variable names are not case sensitive and must begin with an alphabetic
        character or an underscore (_). Variable names can be any length and
	may contain alpha, numeric, and underscore characters only. The
	variable name "str" is reserved to represent the current command string
	and should not be used as a user defined variable name.

	When referencing a variable name defined by the system or another
	module (global), the "!GLOBAL" compiler directive must be used to
	declare the variable or the compiler will not recognize the variable
	name and exit with a syntax error. Global variable declarations should
	appear near the top of your source file.

	Baja modules that use variables require SBBS v2.2 or later.

Synchronet                            7                      Programming Syntax


Arguments:
	When a function requires one or more arguments, there must some amount
	of white space between the function name and each argument.

	In function definitions (in this document), required arguments are
	listed in angled brackets (< >) and optional arguments are listed in
	square brackets ([ ]). The actual bracket symbols are NOT used in the
	source code. They are strictly for documentary purposes.

	When a string variable argument is specified in the definition of a
	function, any string variable name (either local or global) may be
	used. If str is used in the source code as the string variable name,
	the current command string will be used in place of an actual
	user or system string variable.

	An argument of # (pound sign) indicates an integer constant. The actual
	pound sign is not used in the argument. See the section on Integer
	Constants for more details.

	An argument of "str" (with double quotes) indicates a string constant
	argument enclosed in double quotation marks. To place a double
	quotation mark inside a string constant (as part of the actual string
	constant), use \" instead of just " where you want the quotation mark
	to appear in the string.

	An argument of "cstr" (with double quotes) indicates a C string
	constant argument enclosed in double quotation marks. See the next
	section on C strings for the definition of the contents.

	See the beginning of the Functions section for the complete definition
	of all argument types and how they're specified in function
	definitions.

C Strings:

	Some character string arguments are defined as being C type (cstr).
	This indicates the contents of the string use the same special/control
	character escape sequences as defined for the printf() function in the
	ANSI definition of the C programming language. The only exception to
	the ANSI definition, is that \### defines a character value in decimal
	(base 10), not octal (base 8). All escape sequences begin with the
	backslash (\) character. The valid escape sequences are:

        \\      Backslash
        \?      Question mark
        \'      Single quote
        \"      Double quote
        \r      Carriage return
        \n      Line feed
        \t      Horizontal tab
        \b      Backspace
        \a      Bell
        \f      Formfeed
        \v      Vertical tab
        \###    Character value in decimal
        \x##    Character value in hexadecimal

	The text string must be enclosed in double quote (") symbols. Example:

		"Hello, world.\r\n"

	To include an actual back-slash (\) character in a C string, you must
	prefix the back-slash with another back-slash. Example:

		"C:\README.TXT"

	would be an invalid path and filename.

		"C:\\README.TXT"

	would be the correct C string to represent C:\README.TXT.

Integer Constants:

	Many functions allow or require the use of integer constants (as
	opposed to integer variables). An integer constant is a number that is
	"hard-coded" into the resulting executable file and will remain
	constant (never change) from that point on.

	You can specify integer constants in many ways:

	Representation		Range				Examples
	--------------		-----				--------
	Decimal (base 10)	-2147483648 to 2147483647	0, 10, -25
	Hexadecimal (base 16)	0x0 to 0xffffffff		0x7f, 0xA69B
	Octal (base 8)		00 to 037777777777		0377, 0505
	Bit value		.0 to .31			.0, .1, .15
	ASCII value		'' to 'þ'                      'A', ' ', '%'
	Special char		'\r' to '\v' (see C Strings)    '\r', '\n'

	Constants can be modified during specification (no variables may be
	used in the modification). No space is allowed between the numeric
	constant and the modifier symbol. Valid modifiers:

	Symbol			Operation			Example
	------			---------			-------
	+			Addition			10+2
	-			Subtraction			20-8
	*			Multiplication			4*3
	/			Division			36/3
	%			Modulus (remainder)		53%8
	&			Bit-wise AND			695&0x1f
	|			Bit-wise OR			0x10|8
	~			Bit-wise NOT			~3
	^			Bit-wise XOR (exclusive OR)	0xff^12
	>>			Right shift			03700>>4
	<<			Left shift			255<<2

Command Key Constants:

	Some functions require the use of a command key constant. A command key
	constant is a keyword or symbol representing a valid command selected
	by a user.

	The simplest way to specify a command key constant, is to simply
	type the key that you wish to use for a specific command. Example:

		CMDKEY A

	Would use the 'A' key for the command key constant. Simply specifying
	a letter does not indicate case sensitivy (i.e. the above example
	could have been "CMDKEY a" with the same results). 

	To specify a specific case (upper or lower), you must prefix the
	command key with a single quote symbol ('). Example:

		CMDKEY 'a

Synchronet                           11                      Programming Syntax


	To specify a control character (like Ctrl-H, which is a backspace),
	you must prefix the control character (in upper case) with a caret
	(^) symbol. Example:

		CMDKEY ^H

	Valid control character specifications:

		^A	Attribute/color code (internal line editor)
		^B	Beginning of line (internal line editor)
		^C	Abort
		^D	Delete word right (internal line editor)
		^E	End of line (internal line editor)
		^F	Forward cursor (Right arrow key)
		^G	Beep
		^H	Backspace
		^I	Tab
		^J	Line feed (Down arrow key)
		^K	Ctrl-key help menu
		^L	Form feed (Clear screen)
		^M	Carriage return (Enter key)
		^N	Next word (internal line editor)
		^O	Temp pause toggle
		^P	Private message
		^Q	Un-pause
		^R	Redraw line (internal line editor)
		^S	Pause
		^T	Time info
		^U	List users online
		^V	Center line (internal line editor)
		^W	Delete word left (interal line editor)
		^X	Delete line (internal line editor)
		^Y	Delete to end-of line (internal line editor)
		^Z	Raw input mode toggle
		^]	Back cursor (Left arrow key)
		^[	Escape (Esc key)
		^^	Up cursor (Up arrow key)

	You may also specify special control characters (carriage return,
	form feed, etc) be prepending a backslash (i.e. \r, \f, etc). See the
	section on C strings for details.

Synchronet                           12                      Programming Syntax


	Some command key input functions allow the use of slash-commands
	(command keys prepended with a slash character, i.e. /A). The two
	character slash-commands are the only multi-character commands
	supported by command key functions. Example:

		CMDKEYE /A

	Is valid, but:

		CMDKEYE -A

	Is not valid.

	To test specifically for digit (0-9) command keys and slash-digit
	command keys (/0-/9), use DIGIT and EDIGIT respectively. Example:

		CMDKEYE DIGIT

	To test if the user hit a key from 0 to 9, or:

		CMDKEYE EDIGIT

	To test if the user hit a slash-key combination from /0 to /9.

	You may, of course, also test for a specific digit command key:

		CMDKEYE 1
	and
		CMDKEYE /1

	are both valid command key constants.

	To specify # for a command key, use '# (otherwise # will be interpreted
	as the beginning of a comment).

	To specify SPACE bar for the command key, use ' ', example:

		CMDKEY ' '

	Extended ASCII characters (€ for example) are not valid command keys.

Include Files
=============

Source code segments that are to be shared amoung multiple command shells or
modules can be placed into a separate text file (preferrably with a .INC
extension) and included in the source code for multiple modules by using the
"!INCLUDE" compiler directive to specify the filename to include. Example:

!INCLUDE MYDEFS.INC

This is useful when including files supplied by Digital Dynamics or third
party developers to pre-define constants (macros), common sub-routines, or
variable definitions. The following include files are distributed with Baja
(and should not be modified):

ERRNO.INC	Definitions for possible values of _ERRNO system variable
FILE_IO.INC	Constants for use with file I/O functions
DIR_ATTR.INC	Constants for use with SET_FILE_ATTR & GET_FILE_ATTR functions
USERDEFS.INC	Synchronet User constants for use with various functions
NODEDEFS.INC	Synchronet Node constants for use with various functions
SBBSDEFS.INC	Synchronet system variable declarations and constants
		(automatically includes USERDEFS.INC and NODEDEFS.INC)

Take care not to include the same file more than once in the same source code.
It is suggested you put all of your !include statements near the top of your
source file. If you include a file that in-turn includes other files
(SBBSDEFS.INC, for example, includes USERDEFS.INC and NODEDEFS.INC), you
do not need to include the other files. If you !include SBBSDEFS.INC, you
DO NOT need to !incluce NODEDEFS.INC and USERDEFS.INC as well. Take care not
to nest include files too deeply or the compilation will fail.

This compiler directive is very similar to the "#include" directive used by
C compilers, but if a specific path is not specified, only the current
directory will be searched for the file to include.

Macro Definitions
=================

Commonly used character strings and integer constants can be specified as
macros by using the "!DEFINE" compiler directive to specify the macro name to
use and the value of the macro. Example:

!DEFINE MAXIMUM_USERS 250

Now, any place you might want to use the number 250 in your Baja source, you
can use the macro "MAXIMUM_USERS" instead. This makes changing the value of
the numeric or character string constant very easy.

This compiler directive is very similar to the "#define" directive used by
C compilers with the main exception being that the macro name is not case
sensitive.

Global Variable Declarations
============================

When using variables defined by the system (see System Variables) or another
shell or module (see GLOBAL_STR and GLOBAL_INT functions), you must first
declare these variables using the "!GLOBAL" compiler directive. Example:

!GLOBAL SOME_GLOBAL_VAR

Multiple global variables may be declared with one !GLOBAL statement:

!GLOBAL SOME_GLOBAL_VAR ANOTHER_GLOBAL_VAR

If you attempt to use a global variable without first delcaring it, the
compiler will fail to compile the source with an "expected variable name"
syntax error message.

This compiler directive is very similar to the "extern" keyword used by C
compilers.

Programming Style
=================

As stated in the previous section, white space characters at the beginning
of a line are ignored and have no effect on the resulting compilation. But,
whitespace can be very useful in making the source code readable by indenting
conditional blocks of code, and using blank lines to separate blocks of
related code. Comments are also very helpful in making the code readable.

Compare the following source to the example given in the Source Files chapter:

----------------------------------[ Begin ]-----------------------------------

:TOP
CLS
MNEMONICS "~Comment to Sysop\r\n"
MNEMONICS "~Goodbye (Logoff)\r\n"
PRINT "\r\nCommand: "
GETCMD "CG"
COMPARE_KEY C
IF_TRUE
SETSTR "1"
MAIL_SEND_FEEDBACK
GOTO TOP
END_IF
COMPARE_KEY G
IF_TRUE
LOGOFF
GOTO TOP
END_IF

-----------------------------------[ End ]------------------------------------

Without the whitespace and the comments, the code appears much more cryptic
(the control flow is hard to follow). But the code will compile into exactly
the same binary file as the earlier example.

Synchronet                           17                       Programming Style


Consider this more elaborate example using indentation only:

With indentation:

----------------------------------[ Begin ]-----------------------------------

COMPARE_ARS FILE_CMDS=0
IF_TRUE
	COMPARE_USER_MISC UM_ASK_NSCAN
        IF_TRUE
                YES_NO "\r\n\r\nSearch all libraries for new files"
                IF_TRUE
                        FILE_NEW_SCAN_ALL
                        END_IF
                END_IF
        END_IF

-----------------------------------[ End ]------------------------------------

Without indentation:

----------------------------------[ Begin ]-----------------------------------

COMPARE_ARS FILE_CMDS=0
IF_TRUE
COMPARE_USER_MISC UM_ASK_NSCAN
IF_TRUE
YES_NO "\r\n\r\nSearch all libraries for new files"
IF_TRUE
FILE_NEW_SCAN_ALL
END_IF
END_IF
END_IF

-----------------------------------[ End ]------------------------------------

As you can see without the indentation, you can get lost in nested IF
statements trying to understand how the code will execute.

While you may have known quite well what you intended to accomplish and how
you expected the code to execute at the time of writing it, it would be much
harder to understand how the code was expected to execute at a later date
(or by another person) if a consistent indentation style was not used.

Suggested Rules of Style
========================

There isn't a "right" or "wrong" way to use indentation, blank lines,
or comments, but we will present a set of suggested "rules" here. If you decide
you prefer another style, that is fine. The most important thing is that you
are consistent in your use of whatever style you choose.

Top of File Comments
--------------------
Place a comment as the very first line of the file with the name of the .SRC
file. Example:

# EXAMPLE.SRC

Then a block of comment lines that describe what the shell or module's purpose
is, who programmed it, when, where, etc.

Label Comments
--------------
Labels normally represent the beginning of a sub-routine and should be
well commented. A graphical line to show the beginning of a new sub-routine
is often helpful. Example:

############################### My Sub-routine ################################
:MY-SUB

CMD_HOME Comments
-----------------
The CMD_HOME function marks the beginning of a command/menu loop and should
be well commented. Example:

#############
# MAIN MENU #
#############
CMD_HOME

Conditional Indentation
-----------------------
Whenever a block of code is conditionally executed (only executed under
specific conditions), the block of code should be indented one tabstop past
the block header (IF_TRUE, IF_FALSE, ELSE, SWITCH, CASE, CMDKEY, CMDSTR, etc).
The block of code to be indented includes the block terminator (END_IF,
END_CMD, END_CASE, END_SWITCH, etc). Example:

GETCMD "ABCD"

CMDKEY A
        COMPARE_ARS LEVEL 50
        IF_TRUE
                PRINT "You have level 50 or higher.\r\n"
        ELSE
                PRINT "You have level 49 or lower.\r\n"
                END_IF
        END_CMD

Separate Code Blocks
--------------------
Use blank lines to separate medium to large code blocks from other code
(most especially CMDKEY, CMDKEYS, CMDSTR, and SWITCH code blocks). Example:

GETCMD "ABCD"

CMDKEY A
        PRINT "You hit A.\r\n"
        END_CMD

CMDKEY B
        PRINT "You hit B.\r\n"
        END_CMD

End of File Comment
-------------------
Place a comment at the end of the file. Example:

# End of EXAMPLE.SRC

Function Definitions
====================

The remainder of this document is for defining the correct use of all Baja
functions. If you wish to look up a specific function by subject, please refer
to the table of contents or the quick reference at the end of the document.

Argument Types
--------------
Each function definition will begin with the name of the function followed by
all possible arguments (parameters) and the type of each argument. The possible
argument types are:

Type		Description
~~~~		~~~~~~~~~~~
"str"           String constant (contained in double quotes)
"cstr"          C string constant (contained in double quotes)
txt		String constant (no quotes)
#		Integer constant (the # symbol is not part of the syntax)
str_var 	String variable name or 'str' for current command string
int_var 	Integer variable name
any_var 	Any string or integer variable name
char		Character constant (single character, no quotes)
key		Command key constant
keylist 	List of command key constants (no space between each key)

Each argument type is contained in either angled brackets (< and >) to indicate
the argument is required, or square brackets ([ and ]) to indicate the
argument is optional. An argument of [...] indicates a variable number of
optional arguments of the last specified type. Example:

	SPRINTF <str_var> <"cstr"> <any_var> [any_var] [...]

This function definition indicates that the SPRINT function requires a minimum
of three arguments: a string variable, a C string constant, and one or more
variables of either integer or string type.

Required Include Files
----------------------
Following the function argument types, may be one or more required include
(.INC) files. If any files are listed on the same line as the function
(to the right of the page), these files must be included at the top of
your source file to use this function arguments correctly. Example:

	!INCLUDE NODEDEFS.INC

Do not include the same file more than once in the same source file. Once
is enough, and it should be done so near the top of your source (.SRC) file.

Argument Names
--------------
If any arguments are allowed for a function, a list of argument names will
follow the text "args:" below the function name and argument list. This will
help in referencing the individual arguments in the function description.

String Manipulation Functions
=============================

Functions used for manipulating string variables (global or local) and/or the
current command string.

 STR <str_var> [str_var] [...]
args: new_vars
------------------------------
Define one or more local string variables for later use. The new_vars arguments
are the names of the variables to define. These names must not be currently
used by other variables (local or global).

The variable name "str" is used by other functions to refer to the current
command string, and therefore cannot be used as a user defined variable name.

After definition, the variable names can be used by other functions. The
variables will each be initialized to a null string. The variables can only be
referenced in the current shell or module. When the current shell or module is
terminated, the variable names and their contents are lost. If you wish to
retain a variable name and its contents between shells or modules, use a global
variable instead of a local variable.

GLOBAL_STR <str_var> [str_var] [...]
      args: new_vars
------------------------------------
Define one or more global string variables for later use. The arguments are the
names of the variables to define. Each variable name must not be currently used
by another variable (local or global). Global variable names and their contents
are not disposed of until the current user logs off the BBS.

 SET <str_var> <"cstr">
args: dest      value
-----------------------
Writes to the string variable dest, the contents of the C string specified as
value. This function is the Baja equivalent of the standard C strcpy() function
with the exception that the source must be a string constant. Example:

	STR USER_NAME
	SET USER_NAME "John Doe"

When writing to the current command string, use the SETSTR function instead
of this function for best optimization.

COPY <str_var> <any_var>
args: dest      source
------------------------
Copies the source variable (string or integer) into the specified destination
variable. This function is the Baja equivalent of the standard C strcpy()
function with the exception that the source must be a variable, but may be
either of integer or string type. Example:

	# define two variables
	STR VAR1 VAR2
	# copy some text into the first variable
	SET VAR1 "Some Text"
	# copy that variable into the second variable
	COPY VAR2 VAR1
	# display the contents of second variable
	PRINT VAR2

If the source variable is an integer variable, it is converted into
a decimal (base 10) string before the copy is executed. Use SPRINTF if you
want to convert an integer variable into a string using hexadecimal (base 16)
or octal (base 8) representation instead of decimal.

SWAP <str_var> <any_var>
args: var1      var2
------------------------
Exchanges the contents of two string variables, or a string variable and an
integer variable. The first argument (var1) is the name of a string variable
and the second argument (var2) is the name of a string or integer variable.
If var2 is an integer variable, var1 will be set to the decimal representation
of the integer variable contents and var2 will be set the integer
representation of var1 (specified in hex, octal, or decimal). Example:

	INT I
	STR S

	# set S to 100h (256)
	SET S "0x100"
	# set I to 100
	SET I 100
	# swap them
	SWAP S I
	# I now equals 256 and S is "100"

STRCAT <str_var> <str_var or "cstr">
  args: dest	  source
------------------------------------
Concatenates (appends) the contents of a string variable (specified as dest)
with the contents of a C string or string variable specified as source. This
function is the Baja equivalent of the standard C strcat() function.

SPRINTF <str_var> <"cstr"> <any_var> [any_var] [...]
   args: dest	   format   variables
----------------------------------------------------
Writes the specified variables into the string variable (dest) based on
the specified format. This function is the same as PRINTF except that the
output is written into the dest string variable instead of the console. This
function is the Baja equivalent of the standard C sprintf() function with
the exception that all the arguments following the format must be variables
(no constants allowed). See the PRINTF function definition for details.

TIME_STR <str_var> <int_var>
    args: dest	    time
----------------------------
Writes to the string variable (specified as dest) the time and date stored in
the integer variable specified by time. This function is the Baja equivalent
to the standard C ctime() function. Example:

	# Display current time
	INT T
	TIME T
	TIME_STR STR T
	PRINTF "Current time: %s\r\n" STR

Would display the current date/time similar to:

	Current time: Thu Aug 31 1995 08:34 am

DATE_STR <str_var> <int_var>
    args: dest	    time
----------------------------
Writes to the string variable (specified as dest) the date stored in the
integer variable specified by time (obtained with TIME or similar function) in
MM/DD/YY format or DD/MM/YY format if European date format is enabled in SCFG.
Example:

	# Display current date
	INT T
	TIME T
	DATE_STR STR T
	PRINTF "Current date: %s\r\n" STR

Would display the current date similar to:

	Current date: 08/31/95

SECOND_STR <str_var> <int_var>
      args: dest      seconds
------------------------------
Writes to the string variable (specified as dest) the number of seconds
(in HH:MM:SS format) stored in the integer variable specified by seconds.
Example:

	# Display number of seconds elapsed
	INT START END
	TIME START
	PRINT "Wait a period of time, then hit a key..."
	GETKEY
	TIME END
	SUB END START
	SECOND_STR STR END
	PRINTF "\r\n%s time elapsed.\r\n" STR

FTIME_STR <str_var> <"cstr"> <int_var>
     args: dest      format   time
--------------------------------------
Writes to the string variable (specified as dest) the date and time information
from the integer variable (specified as time) formatted according to string
constant specified as format. The format characters are described below:

	%a	abbreviated weekday name
	%A	full weekday name
	%b	abbreviated month name
	%B	full month name
	%c	date and time
	%d	day of month (01-31) (zero-padded)
	%H	hour (24-hour clock) (00-23)
	%I	hour (12-hour clock) (01-12)
	%j	day of the year (001-366)
	%m	month (01-12)
	%M	minute (00-59)
	%p	AM or PM
	%S	second (00-59)
	%U	week number of the year (Sunday as 1st day of week) (00-52)
	%w	weekday (0-6, Sunday is 0)
	%W	week number of the year (Monday as 1st day of week) (00-52)
	%x	date
	%X	time
	%y	year without century (00-99)
	%Y	year with century
	%Z	time zone name, if any
	%%	% (percent symbol)

This function is the Baja equivalent of the standard C strftime() function.
Example:

	# Display current date and time
	INT T
	TIME T
	FTIME_STR STR "Current_Time:%A,%B-%d-%Y,%I:%M %p" T
	PRINTF "%s\r\n" STR

SHIFT_STR [str_var] <#>
     args: string    len
------------------------
This function ("Shift String") shifts the specified string variable if
specified (current command string if not specified) to the left 'len' number of
characters.

	# Displays the string "ELLO"
	SETSTR "HELLO"
        SHIFT_STR 1
	PRINT STR

This function is most often used to parse command string arguments or "stacked"
commands.

STRIP_CTRL [str_var]
      args: string
--------------------
Removes all control characters (and Ctrl-A codes) from specified string
variable. If string is not specified, then the current command string is
processed.

TRUNCSP [str_var]
   args: string
-----------------
Removes (truncates) all white space characters from end of specified string
variable or current comand string (if string not specified).

STRUPR [str_var]
  args: string
----------------
Converts specified string argument to all uppercase characters. This function
is the Baja equivalent to the standard C strupr() function.

STRLWR [str_var]
  args: string
----------------
Converts specified string argument to all lowercase characters. This function
is the Baja equivalent to the standard C strlwr() function.

SETSTR <"cstr">
  args: text
---------------
Writes to current command string, specified constant text string. This
function should be used in place of "SET STR" for best optimization.

REPLACE_TEXT <#> <"cstr">
	args: num text
-------------------------
This function is used to replace a default internal text string (read from the
CTRL\TEXT.DAT file) in a shell or module. The first argument (num) is the text
number to replace (see TEXT.DAT for the number of the text you wish to
replace). The second argument (text) is the C type string to use in place the
current one. All text replacements are lost (back to default TEXT.DAT) when the
user logs off. Example, to replace the "[Hit a key]" prompt with a different
string:

        REPLACE_TEXT 563 "\1n\1h\1b{\1wPAUSE\1b} "

When replacing a TEXT.DAT string that contains %s, %d, or other % specifiers,
you will need to change them to %%s, %%d, etc (without changing the order).

If you wish to globally replace a string (for all shells and modules), you may
want to just edit the CTRL\TEXT.DAT file directly instead.

LOAD_TEXT <"str">
     args: filename
-------------------
Loads an alternate TEXT.DAT file (from CTRL directory, automatically assuming
a .DAT extension for "filename"). Only those text items that are different
from the current TEXT items will be changed. All changes will only be in
effect until the current user logs off or the effects are reversed with the
REVERT_TEXT function. The base filename should be something other than just
"TEXT" (since that is the default TEXT.DAT that is loaded by SBBS).

This function is useful for making multiple languages available to your users.

REVERT_TEXT <# or ALL>
       args: num
----------------------
This function is used to reverse the effects of a previous call to REPLACE_TEXT
or LOAD_TEXT (reverts back to default TEXT.DAT). Example:

        REPLACE_TEXT 563 "\1n-=[Hit a Key]=- "
        PAUSE
        REVERT_TEXT 563

If the argument is the word ALL, then all text strings are reverted to the
original TEXT.DAT entries.

Integer Manipulation Functions
==============================

Functions used for manipulating integer variables (global or local).

 INT <int_var> [int_var] [...]
args: new_vars
------------------------------
Define one or more local integer variables for later use. The new_vars
arguments are the names of the variables to define. These names must not be
currently used by other variables (local or global).

After definition, the variable names can be used by other functions. The
variables will each be initialized to a 0. The variables can only be referenced
in the current shell or module. When the current shell or module is terminated,
the variable names and their contents are lost. If you wish to retain a
variable name and its contents between shells or modules, use a global variable
instead of a local variable.

GLOBAL_INT <int_var> [int_var] [...]
      args: new_vars
------------------------------------
Define one or more global integer variables for later use. The arguments are
the names of the variables to define. Each variable name must not be currently
used by another variable (local or global). Global variable names and their
contents are not disposed of until the current user logs off the BBS.

 SET <int_var> <#>
args: dest      value
---------------------
Writes to the integer variable dest, the integer constant specified as value.

	INT I
	SET I 100

 ADD <int_var> <any_var or #>
args: dest	value
-----------------------------
Adds the value specified in the second argument to the integer variable
specified as dest.

 SUB <int_var> <any_var or #>
args: dest	value
-----------------------------
Subtracts the value specified in the second argument from the integer variable
specified as dest.

 MUL <int_var> <any_var or #>
args: dest	value
-----------------------------
Multiplies the first argument by the value specified in the second argument
and places the result into dest.

 DIV <int_var> <any_var or #>
args: dest	value
-----------------------------
Divides the first argument by the value specified in the second argument
and places the result into dest.

 MOD <int_var> <any_var or #>
args: dest	value
-----------------------------
Divides the first argument by the value specified in the second argument
and places the remainder into dest.

 AND <int_var> <any_var or #>
args: dest	value
-----------------------------
Bit-wise ANDs the value specified in the second argument with the integer
variable specified as dest.

 OR <int_var> <any_var or #>
args: dest	value
----------------------------
Bit-wise ORs the value specified in the second argument with the integer
variable specified as dest.

 NOT <int_var> <any_var or #>
args: dest	value
-----------------------------
Bit-wise ANDs the unary opposite of the value specified in the second argument
with the integer variable specified as dest.

 XOR <int_var> <any_var or #>
args: dest	value
-----------------------------
Bit-wise exclusive ORs the value specified in the second argument with the
integer variable specified as dest.

COPY <int_var> <any_var>
args: dest      source
------------------------
Copies the source variable (string or integer) into the specified destination
variable. Example:

	# define two variables
	INT INT1 INT2
	# place a value into the first variable
	SET VAR1 5
	# copy that variable into the second variable
	COPY VAR2 VAR1
	# display the contents of second variable
	PRINTF "VAR2=%ld\r\n" VAR2

If the source variable is an string variable, it is converted into an integer
before the copy is executed.

SWAP <int_var> <any_var>
args: var1      var2
------------------------
Exchanges the contents of two integer variables, or a string variable and an

and the second argument (var2) is the name of a string or integer variable.

RANDOM <int_var> <#>
  args: dest	  num
---------------------
Places a random number between 0 and num-1 into dest.

Logic/Control Flow Functions
============================

GOTO <txt>
args: label
-----------
This function is used to force the control flow to immediately jump to another
part of the code. A valid label name must follow GOTO as an argument. This
function is very similar to the GOTO command used in the BASIC and C
programming languages or the JMP instruction used in the Assembly programming
language.

CALL <txt>
args: label
-----------
This function is used to execute a sub-routine. The sub-routine must be
defined with the specified label somewhere in the current module. When a
RETURN function is executed in the sub-routine, control flow will return to the
next line following the CALL function that started the sub-routine. The CALL
function is very similar to the GOSUB command used in the BASIC programming
langauge or the CALL instruction used in the Assembly programming language. At
least one RETURN function must exist in the sub-routine. Sub-routines should
not use a GOTO function to "jump out" of the sub-routine.

RETURN
------
This function is used to exit a sub-routine and return to the point in the
code from which it was called with the CALL function. If a RETURN
function is executed without a prior CALL, then the shell or module is
immediately terminated. If a shell is terminated with a user online, they
are immediately logged off. If a module is terminated, execution control
returns to the shell or module that loaded it.

SETLOGIC <TRUE or FALSE or GREATER or LESS>
    args: logic
-------------------------------------------
This function is used to set the current logic state to TRUE (same as
EQUAL), FALSE (same as NOT_EQUAL), GREATER, or LESS. The logic state is set by
many functions, and tested by the IF_... functions to control the flow of
execution.

COMPARE <any_var> <any_var or "cstr" or #>
   args: var	   cmp
------------------------------------------
This function compares any two variables, or a variable and a constant.
If the cmp argument is an integer variable or integer constant and the
var variable is a string variable, then cmp is converted to a string
representation of the cmp variable before the comparison is made. If the cmp
argument is a string variable or string constant and the var variable is
an integer variable, then cmp is converted to an integer before the comparison
is made. The current logic state is set to the result of the comparion:
TRUE (same as EQUAL), FALSE (as an NOT_EQUAL), GREATER, or LESS.



_______________________________________________________________________________
Synchronet                           32            Logic/Control Flow Functions


IF_TRUE
-------
If the current logic state is set to TRUE, then following block of code
(ending in an END_IF or ELSE function) will be executed. Otherwise,
the interpreter will skip the code until an ELSE or END_IF function is found
and resume execution from that point. This function is the same as IF_EQUAL.

IF_FALSE
--------
This function is identical to the IF_TRUE function except that it works in the
opposite manor in regards to the current logic state. This function is the
same as IF_NOT_EQUAL.

IF_GREATER
----------
If the current logic state is set to GREATER by a subsequent COMPARE function,
the following IF_... block will be executed.

IF_GREATER_OR_EQUAL
-------------------
If the current logic state is set to GREATER or EQUAL, the following IF_...
block will be executed. This function is the same as IF_EQUAL_OR_GREATER.

IF_LESS
-------
If the current logic state is set to LESS by a subsequent COMPARE function,
the following block will be executed.

IF_LESS_OR_EQUAL
----------------
If the current logic state is set to LESS or EQUAL, the following code block
will be executed. This function is the same as IF_EQUAL_OR_LESS.

ELSE
----
This function marks the end of an IF_... block of code and begins an alternate
block of code to be executed if the condition is not met for the IF_...
function. The block of code is terminated with an END_IF function.

END_IF
------
This function is used to terminate an IF_... or  ELSE code block. Every IF_...
function must be followed by an ELSE or END_IF instuction, and every ELSE
function must be followed by an END_IF.

SWITCH <int_var>
----------------
CASE <#>
--------
END_CASE
--------
DEFAULT
-------
END_SWITCH
----------
The SWITCH function is used in conjunction with the CASE, DEFAULT, END_CASE,
and END_SWITCH functions to replace multiple COMPARE/IF_.../ELSE statements.

Example:

	INT I
	RANDOM I 3
	COMPARE I 0
	IF_EQUAL
		PRINT "Zero"
	ELSE
		COMPARE I 1
		IF_EQUAL
			PRINT "One"
		ELSE
			COMPARE I 2
			IF_EQUAL
				PRINT "Two"
				END_IF
			END_IF
		END_IF

Could be replaced with:

	INT I
	RANDOM I 3
	SWITCH I
		CASE 0
			PRINT "Zero"
			END_CASE
		CASE 1
			PRINT "One"
			END_CASE
		CASE 2
			PRINT "Two"
			END_CASE
		DEFAULT
			PRINTF "Random returned %ld" I
			END_CASE
		END_SWITCH





_______________________________________________________________________________
Synchronet                           34            Logic/Control Flow Functions


If the SWITCH argument value is equal to one of the specified CASE arguments,
then that CASE code block is executed until an END_CASE function is reached.
If an END_CASE function does not exist in the code block, the execution will
continue through (fall-through) the following CASE or DEFAULT functions until
an END_CASE or END_SWITCH function is reached.

If the SWITCH argument does not match any of the CASE arguments, the DEFAULT
code block will be executed until an END_CASE or END_SWITCH function is
reached. If a DEFAULT function is not specified, execution will skip to the
END_SWITCH function. Only one DEFAULT code block should be specified per
SWITCH/END_SWITCH block, if used at all. This function set is the Baja
equivalent of the standard C switch(), case:, default:, and break keywords.

CMD_HOME
--------
This function (called "Command Home") is very similar to a label. It is
a convenience function for programming menu commands. It sets a return
point (or anchor, if you will) for the automatic looping on a specific menu.
Execution control is returned to the point in the code where the last CMD_HOME
was specified by the END_CMD function.

CMDKEY <key>
 args:	cmd
------------
This function (called "Command Key") is like a combination of the
COMPARE_KEY and IF_TRUE functions. It is usually immediately preceded by
a GETCMD, GETKEY, GETSTR or similar function.

If the current command key matches the command key constant (cmd), then the
block of code following (terminated with an END_CMD function) will be executed.
When the END_CMD function is executed, execution control returns to the most
recently executed CMD_HOME function. If a RETURN or GOTO function will be
executed before the END_CMD function, then a CMD_POP function must be executed
to tell the interpreter to "forget" the previous CMD_HOME function. Even if
execution control will cause the END_CMD function to never be executed, it
still must be present to define the code block so that it can be skipped if the
CMDKEY comparison is false.

Synchronet                           35            Logic/Control Flow Functions


CMDKEYS <keylist>
  args:  cmds
-----------------
This function is identical to the CMDKEY function with the exception that the
argument is a list of valid keys and if the current command key matches any
of those listed, the following code block is executed.

CMDSTR <"cstr">
  args: cmd
---------------
This function (called "Command Str") is identical to the CMDKEY function
with the exception that the argument is a C type string. It is usually
immediately preceded by a GETSTR or similar function.

END_CMD
-------
This function is used to mark the end of a CMDKEY, CMDKEYS, or CMDSTR code
block.

CMD_POP
-------
This function tells the interpreter to "forget" the most recently executed
CMD_HOME function. It should only be used when a CMDKEY, CMDKEYS, or CMDSTR
code block contains a GOTO or RETURN function.

COMPARE_KEY <key>
       args: cmd
-----------------
This function is identcal to the CMDKEY function in regards to the
key argument. The current command key is set by the GETCMD, GETKEY, GETSTR
or similar functions. If the current command key matches the key argument,
the current logic state is set to TRUE, otherwise it is set to FALSE.

As with all COMPARE functions, it is usually immediately followed by an
IF_TRUE or IF_FALSE function.

COMPARE_KEYS <keylist>
	args: cmds
----------------------
This function is identical to the CMDKEYS functions in regards to the
keylist argument. If the current command key is contained in the keylist,
then the current logic state is set to TRUE, otherwise it is set to FALSE.

COMPARE_STR <"cstr">
       args: string
--------------------
This function compares the current command string (set by the SETSTR,
GETSTR, or similar functions) against the C type string argument and sets
the current logic state to TRUE or FALSE accordingly. The comparison is not
case sensitive. This function is the Baja equivalent to the standard C
stricmp() function.

COMPARE_WORD <"cstr">
	args: string
---------------------
This function is identical to the COMPARE_STR function with the
exception that the current command string must only match the string argument
for as many characters as included in the string argument.

If for example, the current command string is "OPEN BLACKJACK" then the line:

        COMPARE_WORD "OPEN"

would set the current logic state to TRUE since the first 4 characters of
each string match, but the line:

        COMPARE_STR "OPEN"

would set the current logic state to FALSE since the strings do not entirely
match.

COMPARE_ARS <txt>
       args: ars
-----------------
This function compares the requirement string argument ars against the
information on the current user and sets the current logic state to either
TRUE or FALSE based on the result of the comparison. See the ARS chapter of
the Synchronet sysop manual for details on the syntax of ARS.

Example:
                COMPARE_ARS LEVEL 60
                IF_TRUE
                        PRINT "You have level 60 or higher.\r\n"
                        END_IF

COMPARE_STRN <#>  <str_var> <str_var or "cstr">
	args: num  str1      str2
-----------------------------------------------
This function is used to compare the first num characters of strings str1
and str2. This function is the Baja equivalent of the standard C strnicmp()
function. If the two strings are the same (ignoring case) for the the first
num characters, the current logic state is set to TRUE, otherwise it is set
to FALSE.

COMPARE_SUBSTR <str_var> <str_var or "cstr">
	  args: str1	  str2
--------------------------------------------
This function is used to check if str2 is contained in str1 (case sensitive).
This function is the Baja equivalent of the standard C strstr() function.
If str2 is located in str1, the current logic state is set to TRUE, otherwise
it is set to FALSE. This following example would set the current logic state
to TRUE:

	SETSTR "This is a test"
	COMPARE_SUBSTR STR "test"

Display Functions
=================

Display functions are used to display output to the user either locally,
remotely, or both.

PRINT <"cstr" or var>
args:  string
---------------------
This function sends a string of characters to the user (both locally and
remotely, if applicable). The string to be printed can extend beyond the 80th
column of the screen, but when printing multiple lines, multiple consecutive
PRINT statements are preferrred.

Example:
                PRINT "hello, world\r\n"
     or:
                STR my_var
                SET my_var "hello, world\r\n"
                PRINT my_var

The string can contain color codes using Synchronet Ctrl-A codes. See the
Synchronet sysop manual for the definition of Ctrl-A codes and their usage.
If you are using an ASCII editor that does not support control characters,
a "\1" can be used in place of the Ctrl-A (smiley face) character.

Variables can also be included in the string (example: user's name, sysop's
name, BBS name, etc) by using Synchronet supported @-codes and command line
% specifiers. See the Synchronet sysop manual for the definition of @-codes
and command line % specifiers. The %s command line specifier, when used, is
replaced with the current command string and %f is replaced with the complete
path of the current file directory. Be careful not to confuse command line %
specifiers (%a, %b, etc) with printf % specifiers (described later). They can
actually be used together in the same string (supported by PRINTF functions) by
using double % for the command line % specifiers (e.g. %%s instead of %s).

PRINTF <"cstr"> [any_var] [...]
 args:	format	 variables
-------------------------------
This function is similar to print, except that defined variables can be placed
(formatted) into to displayed text output. This function is the Baja
equivalent of the standard C printf() function. The format argument is a C type
string with C printf() % specifiers for variable formatting.

The valid specifiers are:

        %%      Percent symbol
        %s      String variable
        %#s     String variable, minimum # chars wide, right justified
        %-#s    String variable, minimum # chars wide, left justified
        %.#s    String variable, maximum # chars wide
        %#.#s   String variable, min and max width specified, right justified
        %-#.#s  String variable, min and max width specified, left justified
        %ld     Integer variable, decimal - use lx for hexadecimal (lX=caps)
        %#ld    Integer variable minimum # chars wide right justified
        %-#ld   Integer variable minimum # chars wide left justified
        %0#ld   Integer variable minimum # digits wide zero padded

Multiple variable names may be specified after the str argument, but each
variable MUST be properly represented in the str argument with the correct
PRINTF specifier (either %ld, %lx, or %s).

Example:
        STR s
        SET s "hello, world"
        PRINTF "~%s~\r\n"       s
        PRINTF "~%10s~\r\n"     s
        PRINTF "~%.10s~\r\n"    s
        PRINTF "~%-10s~\r\n"    s
        PRINTF "~%.15s~\r\n"    s
        PRINTF "~%-15s~\r\n"    s
        PRINTF "~%15.10s~\r\n"  s
        PRINTF "~%-15.10s~\r\n" s

Would produce the following display:

        ~hello, world~
        ~hello, world~
        ~hello, wor~
        ~hello, world~
        ~hello, world   ~
        ~     hello, wor~
        ~hello, wor     ~

PRINT_LOCAL <"cstr">
       args:  string
--------------------
This function works identical to the PRINT function with the exception that
the output is only displayed locally (on the BBS console). Ctrl-A codes
and @-codes are not supported.

PRINT_REMOTE <"cstr">
	args: string
---------------------
This function works identical to the PRINT function with the exception that
the output is only displayed remotely (on the user's terminal). If the current
user is not logged on remotely, then no output is performed. Ctrl-A codes
and @-codes are not supported.

PRINTSTR
--------
This function works identical to the PRINT function with the exception that
this function does not accept a string argument, and instead uses the current
command string (set with SETSTR, GETSTR, or similar function) as the character
string to print.

Example:
                SETSTR "hello, world\r\n"
                PRINTSTR

PRINTKEY
--------
This function displays the current command key. The command key is normally
obtained with the GETKEY, GETCMD, or similar function.

MNEMONICS <"cstr">
     args: string
------------------
This function works identical to the PRINT function with the exception that
the output is automatically colorized and characters following a tilde (~)
are considered a mnemonic command character (hot key) and are high-lighted
or placed in parentheses if the user's terminal does not support ANSI. If
Ctrl-A codes are included in the str argument, then the automatic colorization
and high-lighting is not used.

Example:
                mnemonics "Select: ~Good, ~Bad, or ~Indifferent: "

CLS
---
This function clears the current text screen.

CRLF
----
This function displays a carriage return/line feed (new line). It is equivalent
to PRINT "\r\n", but requires less memory and executes faster.

PRINTFILE <"str" or str_var> [#]                                SBBSDEFS.INC
     args: file 	      mode
----------------------------------
Displays the contents of the file to the user (both locally and remotely, if
applicable).

Valid mode parameters:

P_NOABORT	Disallows abortion of display with Ctrl-C
P_SAVEATR	Retain attributes (colors) after display
P_NOATCODES	Don't expand @-code variables/actions
P_OPENCLOSE	Open and close immediately (before display)

Multiple mode parameters can be specified by joining them together with the
OR (|) symbol.

Example:
		!INCLUDE SBBSDEFS.INC
		PRINTFILE "C:\TEXT\HELP.TXT" P_NOABORT|P_OPENCLOSE

PRINTTAIL <str_var> <#>   <#>					SBBSDEFS.INC
     args: file      mode  x
-----------------------------
Displays the last x number of lines of file. The valid mode parameters are the
same as those shown for the PRINTFILE function. If you don't want any of the
mode values, use 0 for the mode.

PRINTFILE_STR
-------------
This function is indentical to the PRINTFILE function, with the exception that
there is no argument, the current command string is used for the path and
filename instead.

PRINTFILE_LOCAL <"str">
	   args: file
-----------------------
This function works identical to the PRINTFILE function, with the exception
that the contents are only displayed locally.

PRINTFILE_REMOTE <"str">
	    args: file
----------------------
This function works identical to the PRINTFILE function, with the exception
that the contents are only displayed remotely. If the user is not logged on
remotely, then no output is performed.

LIST_TEXT_FILE
--------------
This function works similar to the PRINTFILE function, with the exception
that the system password is required when run remotely and the user is prompted
to enter the path and name of the file to list.

EDIT_TEXT_FILE
--------------
This function is generally for sysop use only. It will automatically prompt
the user (if remote) for the system password, and then prompt them for the
path and name of the file to edit.

PAUSE
-----
This function produces a "[Hit a key]" prompt and waits for the user to hit a
key.

MENU <"str">
args: file
----------
This function is similar to the PRINTFILE function with the exception that the
TEXT\MENU directory is assumed to be the root path for the file and the file's
extension (.ASC, .ANS, .MON, or .RIP) should not be specified. This function
will automatically display the correct file based on the what the user's
terminal supports and which menu files are available. To display a menu file
in a different directory, a sub-directory can be specified before the filename.
For example, do display the MAIN.* menu file in the TEXT\MENU\SIMPLE directory,
you would use the following:

	MENU "SIMPLE\MAIN"

To display the MAIN.* menu file in the TEXT\MENU directory, you would use the
following:

	MENU "MAIN"

You can also change the default menu directory with the SET_MENU_DIR function.
Using the SET_MENU_FILE function, you can override the location and filename
for MENUs that are displayed from within core functions of Synchronet.

NODELIST_ALL
------------
This function displays the current status of all nodes.

NODELIST_USERS
--------------
This function displays the current status of all nodes that are in use.

USERLIST_SUB
------------
This function displays all users that have access to the current message
sub-board.

USERLIST_DIR

USERLIST_ALL
------------
This function displays all users that have active accounts on the BBS.

USERLIST_LOGONS
---------------
This function displays a list of the users who have logged on today.

YES_NO <"cstr">
  args: question
----------------
This function displays the question argument with automatic colorization
followed by the text " (Y/n) ? " and waits for the user to hit 'Y', 'N' or CR.
If CR (enter) is hit, then 'Y' is assumed. If the answer to the prompt is 'Y',
then the current logic state is set to TRUE, otherwise it is set to FALSE.

Example:
                YES_NO "Logoff Now"
                IF_TRUE
                        LOGOFF
                        END_IF

NO_YES <"cstr">
  args: question
----------------
This function is identical to the YES_NO function with the exception that the
string is followed by text " (y/N) ? " and if CR is hit, then 'N' is assumed.
If the answer to the prompt is 'N', then the current logic state is set to
TRUE, otherwise it is set to FALSE.

Example:
                NO_YES "Logoff Now"
                IF_FALSE

"TEXT\file.SIF".

The original SIF data file is created with the CREATE_SIF function. The
SIF file used to create and display the data file do not have to be the same
SIF file, but should have the same order and format of data types.

See the Synchronet Sysop Manual for details on the SIF file format.

SAVELINE
--------
This function saves the current line of text on the console to an internal

Input Functions
===============

Input functions are used to obtain input data from the user (most often from
the user's keyboard).

INKEY
-----
Checks to see if the user has hit a key. If the user has hit a key, the
current command key is set to the hit key and the current logic state is
set to TRUE, otherwise the logic state is set to FALSE. This function does
not wait for a user to hit a key.

GETKEY
------
Waits for a single key from the user. The key is converted to upper case (if
a letter) and becomes the current command key for functions such as CMDKEY,
COMPARE_KEY, etc. The key is not echoed (displayed). Use the PRINTKEY function
to display a key accepted with this function.

GETKEYE
-------
This function is identical to the GETKEY function with the exception that
"slash commands" are allowed. That is, if the user hits the slash (/) key,
then the slash is echoed and the system waits for another key from the user.
The second key is converted to upper case (if a letter) and the slash/key
combination becomes the current command key for functions such as CMDKEY,
COMPARE_KEY, etc. The second key is not echoed (displayed). Use the PRINTKEY
function to display a key accepted with this function.

GETCMD <"cstr">
  args: keys
---------------
This function is very similar to the GETKEY function, except that the 'keys'
argument specifies the only valid key to be accepted. The keys arguments is
a C style string, so carriage return (ENTER) is specified with a \r. If, for
example, you wanted to allow the user to hit A, B, C or ENTER, then you would
use the following:

        GETCMD "ABC\r"

When an allowed key is hit, the key is converted to upper case (if a letter)
and echoed (displayed) followed by a CRLF automatically. The key then becomes
the current command key for functions such as CMDKEY, COMPARE_KEY, etc.

Ctrl-C will always be allowed, in which case the command key becomes ^C.

GETSTR [str_var] [#]  [#]					SBBSDEFS.INC
  args: string	  max  mode
---------------------------
This function ("Get String"), is used to accept a string of characters from
the user. The 'max' argument specifies the maximum length allowed for the
string (in characters). 'max' should not exceed 79 characters for most uses.
This function allows the user to enter any valid ASCII characters to form
command words, sentences, etc. Control will not return to the module until the
user either hits CR (ENTER), Ctrl-C, or Ctrl-V or is disconnected. The
resultant string can then be used in functions such as CMDSTR, COMPARE_STR,
COMPARE, SHIFT_STR, XTRN_EXEC, FILE_DOWNLOAD, etc.

If string is not specified, the current command string is written to. If
max is not specified, the value 128 is used.

The valid mode parameters (defined in SBBSDEFS.INC) are:

Mode		Description
~~~~		~~~~~~~~~~~
K_UPPER 	Converts all letters to upper case
K_UPRLWR	Upper/Lower case automatically
K_NUMBER	Allow numbers only
K_WRAP		Allows word wrap
K_MSG		Allows Ctrl-A codes and Ctrl-G (beep)
K_SPIN		Spinning cursor
K_LINE		Input line (inverse color)
K_EDIT		Edit string passed
K_NOCRLF	Don't print CRLF after string input
K_ALPHA 	Only allow alphabetic characters
K_LOWPRIO	low priority input
K_NOEXASC	No extended ASCII allowed
K_E71DETECT	Detect E-7-1 terminal type
K_AUTODEL	Auto-delete text (used with EDIT)
K_NOECHO	Don't echo input to local or remote console

Multiple mode parameters can be used by ORing them together with the | symbol.
Example:

	GETSTR STR 25 K_UPRLWR|K_EDIT|K_AUTODEL

GETLINE [str_var] [#]
   args: string    max
--------------------------
This function is identical to GETSTR with the exception that an inverse line
is displayed to the user (if the user has an ANSI terminal) to show the maximum
length of the input string.

GETSTRUPR [str_var] [#]
     args: string    max
------------------------
This function ("Get String Upper") is identical to GETSTR with the exception
that the string is automatically converted to uppercase as the user types.

GETNAME [str_var] [#]
   args: string    max
----------------------
This function is identical to GETSTR with the exception that the string is
automatically converted to "Capitalized" words (as in a proper noun) as the
user types.

GETFILESPEC
-----------
This function is specifically used to accept a file specification (name and/or
wildcard characters) from the user. It will automatically display a prompt
similar to:

Filespec [*.*]:

before waiting for the user to input the file specification. If the user hits
CR, *.* is assumed to be the file specification. If a period is not included
in the string, a ".*" is automatically appended (so CR, "*" and "*.*" all
result in the same string: "*.*"). If the user enters "A*", the string becomes
"A*.*". If the user enters "A*." the string remains unchanged. If the user
hits Ctrl-C, the current logic state is set to FALSE. Otherwise, the logic
state is set to TRUE.

Example:

        GETFILESPEC
        IF_TRUE
                FILE_DOWNLOAD
                END_IF

GETLINES
--------
This function only has an effect if the user is logged on remotely, has
ANSI terminal capability and their screen lines set to "Auto-detect". It
sends an ANSI sequence to detect the number of screen lines in the text window
of the remote terminal and waits for a response.

GETNUM [any_var] <#>
  args: dest	  max
---------------------
This function is similar to GETSTR with the exception that it only excepts
numbers as input and automatically stops accepting input if the number being
input would exceed max (maximum of 32767). The dest variable (current
command string if not specified) will contain the number and the current logic
state will be TRUE unless the user hit 'Q', Ctrl-C, or enter instead of a
number.

GET_TEMPLATE <"str">
------------------
This function is much line GETLINE except that an input template is passed
as an argument to this function. The template is useful when requiring the
user to input a string of a fixed format, like a date, for example. The
characters in the template have special meaning: N indicates only a number may
be used in this position, A indicates only an alphabetic character, and !
indicates any character may be used in that position. Characters other than
N, A, or ! are automatically displayed and used in the current command string
in those positions. The first character of the template must be either N, A, or
!. An example (date format):

	GET_TEMPLATE "NN/NN/NN"

would require the user to input two numbers, then automatically skip the
slash character, two more numbers, skip the slash, then two more numbers.

Another example (Canadian postal code):

	GET_TEMPLATE "ANA NAN"

would require the user to input a letter, then a number, another letter,
automatically skip the space, another number, another letter, and one more
number. No other characters (symbols or otherwise) would be allowed in the
string using the above template example.

CHKSYSPASS
----------
This function ("Check System Password") displays an SY: prompt to the user
and waits for the user to input the system password (with no echo). If the
password is correct, the current logic state is set to TRUE, otherwise it
is set to FALSE.

CREATE_SIF <"str">
      args: file
----------------
This function is used to present the user with a SIF questionnaire and store
their answers in a data file. The str argument is the filename of a .SIF file
(without the .SIF extension) located in your Synchronet TEXT directory. The
user's answers are stored in a data file whose path and filename are specified
in the current command string. The data file should be specified with the
user's number to ensure unique data filenames. Example:

	SETSTR "C:\\SBBS\\USER%4.DAT"
	CREATE_SIF "NEWUSER"

This would read the file TEXT\NEWUSER.SIF and the user would fill-out the
questionnaire with all answers being stored in the file C:\SBBS\USER####.DAT
(where #### would be the user's number padded with zeros to four digits).
The questionnaire could then be read back with the answers filled in.
Example:

	SETSTR "C:\\SBBS\\USER%4.DAT"
	READ_SIF "NEWUSER"

Miscellaneous Functions
=======================

ONLINE
------
Assume online execution (default mode), auto-return from module if user is
disconnected or logged off.

OFFLINE
-------
Assume offline execution, no carrier and no one online locally. If used
(for OFFLINE modules), must be the FIRST executed function of the module.

LOGIN <"cstr">
 args: pwprompt
---------------
Process login attempt using the current command string as the user name/number
and pwprompt for the password prompt. This function may also prompt for the
system password with the SY: prompt if the user has level 90 or higher.

LOGON
-----
Logon the currently logged-in user. This function must be called before the
LOGIN module terminates if the user is to be allowed online. This function,
in turn, executs the LOGON module, if one is configured in SCFG.

LOGOFF
------
This function prompts the user if they really wish to log off. If they
answer Yes, then any logoff events are executed and the LOGOFF menu file
is displayed before they are disconnected.

LOGOFF_FAST
-----------
This function immediately drops carrier and logs the user off. It differs
from the HANGUP function in that it performs a SYNC function, then it
immediately drops carrier, as opposed to the HANGUP function wich does not
perform a SYNC operation and has a buffer flush delay before actually
dropping carrier.

LOGOUT
------
Logout the currently logged-on user. This function is used solely for
re-logging-in an already connected user.

NEWUSER
-------
Begins the new user application process.

SET_MENU_DIR <"str">
	args: dir
------------------
This function sets the default menu directory for the MENU function (normally
..\TEXT\MENU). This function is useful for globally changing the directory
where MENU files will be retrieved from (including internal Synchronet
functions that can not be modified with a shell). The following is an example
of how to use this function along with the MENU function:

        # The next line would display ..\TEXT\MENU\MAIN.*
	MENU "MAIN"

        # Change the directory for menus

	MENU_DIR "..\TEXT\MYMENUS"

        # This next line would now display ..\TEXT\MYMENUS\MAIN.*
	MENU "MAIN"

SET_MENU_FILE <"str">
	 args: path_and_filename
--------------------------------
This function is used to OVERRIDE the filename specified for a menu displayed
in an internal Synchronet function. Example:

	SET_MENU_FILE "..\TEXT\MYMENUS\EMAIL.RIP"
        MAIL_READ

SYNC
----
This function synchronizes the local and remote displays (waits for the remote
terminal to catch up), displays any internode messages waiting for this node,
and synchronizes the current node status with the shared node database file.
It should be called before all command prompts are displayed.

ASYNC
-----
This function is identical to the SYNC function with the exception that any
pending output (menu, text file, etc.) can be aborted by hitting any key.

RIOSYNC
-------
This function synchronizes the remote console (waits for output buffers to
be sent or aborted).

PUT_NODE
--------
Force flush (write) of current node information (who's online, etc) to disk.

PAUSE_RESET
-----------
This function resets the line counter used for the automatic screen pause
feature.

CLEAR_ABORT
-----------
This function clears the abort (Ctrl-C) status flag.

UNGETKEY
--------
This function puts the current command key into the input buffer to be the
next key retrieved with GETKEY, GETCMD, GETSTR, or similar functions.

EXEC <"str">
args: cmd
----------
This function calls the operating system to spawn the 'cmd' command line
specified. Remote users will not see or be able to interact with the program
executed unless the program is aware of the remote user and is specifically
designed to be run remotely (i.e. DOORs).

If an internal DOS command is to be executed, a command processor must be
loaded. Example:

	EXEC "COMMAND /C COPY C:\FILES\NEWFILE.TXT C:\DOWNLOADS"

Synchronet's command line specifiers can also be used:

	EXEC "%!dsz portx %u,%i sz file.zip"

See the Synchronet sysop manual, appendix A for a list of valid specifiers.
When used from a command shell or module, %f will be replaced with the path
to the current file directory, and %s will be replaced with the current
command string.

EXEC_INT <"str">
    args: cmd
--------------
This function ("Execute with I/O intercepted") is identical to the EXEC
function with the exception that DOS I/O interrupts (screen output and keyboard
input) is intercepted and redirected to the COM port if the user is logged on
remotely. This allows programs that use standard DOS I/O for screen output
to be displayed remotely. Example:

	EXEC_INT "COMMAND /C DIR C:\FILES\*.TXT"

EXEC_BIN <"str">
    args: name
--------------
This function loads and executes a Baja module. A .BIN file with the filename
specified as the 'name' argument must exist in the Synchronet EXEC directory
for this function. If for example, you want a shell to load and execute
MYMOD.BIN from your EXEC directory, you would add the following to one or more
command shells:

	EXEC_BIN "MYMOD"

EXEC_XTRN <"str">
     args: code
---------------
This function executes the online external program specified by it's internal
code with the 'code' argument. If an online external program is not found with
a matching internal code or the user does not have access to that program, this
function does nothing.

string argument is not used, but instead the current command string is written
to the system's activity log file.

LOGKEY
------
This function writes the current command key to the system's activity log file
for the current date if the user is logged on remotely.

LOGKEY_COMMA
------------
This function is identical to the LOGKEY function, with the exception that a
comma (,) is prepended to the command key to separate it visually from other
logged command keys.

NODE_STATUS <#> 						NODEDEFS.INC
       args: status

File I/O Functions
==================

These functions allow Baja modules to read (input) from and write (ouput) to
disk files. If any of the following functions fail, the current logic state
will be set to FALSE and the system variable _ERRNO will contain the reason
for the failure. All file I/O functions require SBBS v2.2 or later.

FOPEN <int_var> <#>	<"str" or str_var>                      FILE_IO.INC
 args: handle	 access  path_and_filename
------------------------------------------
This function opens or creates a disk file (path_and_filename) for read and/or
write access. This function is the Baja equivalent of the standard C fopen()
function. No file I/O operations can be performed on a file until it has been
opened with this function. The 'handle' argument must be a defined integer
variable name. The 'access' argument is the requested open access. The access
flags (defined in FILE_IO.INC) are:

Access Flag	Description
~~~~~~~~~~~	~~~~~~~~~~~
O_RDONLY	Read Only
O_WRONLY	Write Only
O_RDWR		Read and write
O_CREAT 	Create	  (create if doesn't exist)
O_APPEND	Append	  (writes to end of file)
O_TRUNC 	Truncate  (truncates file to 0 bytes automatically)
O_EXCL		Exclusive (only open/create if file doesn't exist)
O_DENYNONE	Deny None (shareble, for use with record locking)

To specify multiple access flags, place an OR symbol (|) between each. Example:

	O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC

If the file does not exist it will be created if the O_CREAT access was
specified. If the O_CREAT and O_EXCL access flags are set then the open will
fail if the file already exists.

Example:

	!INCLUDE FILE_IO.INC

        INT file
	FOPEN file O_RDWR|O_CREAT "%jFILENAME.EXT"

Would open the file FILENAME.EXT in the BBS data directory (%j is the
Synchronet command line % specifier for the data directory) for reading and
writing, creating it if it didn't already exist. All later accesses to the file
must use the same integer variable ("file" in the above example). If the open
is successful, the current logic state is set to TRUE, otherwise it is set to
FALSE.

FCLOSE <int_var>
  args: handle
----------------
All files opened with the FOPEN function remain open until either this function
(FCLOSE) is used to close the file (using the same unmodified 'handle') or the
current shell or module is terminated. This function is the Baja equivalent
of the standard C fclose() function. A maximum of 10 files can be concurrently
opened by a shell or module at any given time.

FREAD <int_var> <any_var> [int_var or #]
 args: handle	 dest	   length
----------------------------------------
This function is used to read from a disk file (specified by 'handle') into a
string or integer variable (specified by 'dest') from the current file
position. This function is the Baja equivalent of the standard C fread()
function.

The optional 'length' argument specifies the number of bytes to read. It must
be between 1 and 4 if the dest argument is an integer variable and between 1
and 1024 if the dest argument is a string variable. If 'length' is not
specified, then 4 bytes is assumed for integer variables or the current string
length for string variables (or 128 if an uninitialized or 0 length string
variable is specified). The current file position will be automatically moved
forward by the number of bytes successfully read from the file.

If the FSET_ETX function has been used to set the end-of-text character to
something other than 0 and the dest argument is a string variable, the string
will be terminated at the first end-of-text character read from the file from
the current position.

It is suggested that a 'length' argument always be specified for string
variable destinations, though it is not usually necessary for integer variable
destinations.

FWRITE <int_var> <any_var> [int_var or #]
  args: handle	  source    length
-----------------------------------------
This function is used to write an integer or string variable ('source') to a
disk file ('handle') at the current file position. This function is the Baja
equivalent of the standard C fwrite() function. If the optional 'length'
argument is specified, it will determine the number of bytes written to the
file. If 'source' is a string variable and the number of bytes to be written
exceeds the string length, the current end-of-text character will be used to
fill the extra bytes. If 'length' is not specified, 4 bytes will be used for
integer 'source' variables and the current string length will be used for
string 'source' variables. The current file position will be automatically
moved forward by the number of bytes successfully written to the file.

FFLUSH <int_var>
  args: handle
----------------
This function forces any pending writes to the disk file ('handle'). All files
opened by Baja modules use buffered I/O for performance. Closing an open file
flushes any pending output as well. You may wish to use this function in

FGET_LENGTH <int_var> <int_var>
       args: handle    length
-------------------------------
This function gets the current length (in bytes) of the file pointed to by
'handle', and writes the value to the integer variable 'length'. This function
is the Baja equivalent of the standard C filelength() function.

FSET_LENGTH <int_var> <int_var>
       args: handle    length
-------------------------------
This function changes the length of the file pointed to by 'handle' to the
value contained in the integer variable 'length'. If the file is shortened,
any bytes beyond the specified length are lost. If the file is extended, the
unused bytes will be automatically padded with 0. This function is the Baja
equivalent of the standard C chsize() function.

FGET_TIME <int_var> <int_var>
     args: handle    time
-----------------------------
This function gets the current date/time stamp of the file pointed to by
'handle' and writes this value into the 'time' variable. This function is
the Baja equivalent of the standard C getftime() function.

FSET_TIME <int_var> <int_var>
     args: handle    time
-----------------------------
This function sets the current date/time stamp of the file pointed to by
'handle' to the value contained in the 'time' variable. This function is the
Baja equivalent of the standard C setftime() function.

FEOF <int_var>
args: handle
--------------
This function checks the file specified by 'handle' to see if the current
file position is at the end of the file. If it is currently at the end of the
file, the current logic state is set to TRUE. If it is not at the end of the
file or the file 'handle' is not currently open, the logic state is set to
FALSE. This function is the Baja equivalent of the standard C feof() function.

FGET_POS <int_var> <int_var>
    args: handle    offset
----------------------------
This function gets the current file position (in bytes from the beginning of
the file) for the file specified by 'handle' and writes the value into the
integer variable 'offset'. This function is the Baja equivalent of the
standard C ftell() function.

FSET_POS <int_var> <int_var or #> [#]				FILE_IO.INC
    args: handle    offset	   whence
-----------------------------------------
This function is used to reposition (seek) within the file specified by
'handle' to the offset specified by 'offset' from 'whence', if specified.
If 'whence' is not specified the 'offset' will be considered from the beginning
of the file. This function is the Baja equivalent of the standard C fseek()
function. The valid values of whence (defined in FILE_IO.INC) are:

Whence		Description
~~~~~~		~~~~~~~~~~~
SEEK_SET	From the beginning of the file
SEEK_CUR	From current file position
SEEK_END	From end of file

The 'offset' (not offspring) variable can be either an integer variable or
an integer constant. It may be negative (to move the file position backwards),
positive (forwards), or 0 (to specify no offset from 'whence').

Example:

	!INCLUDE FILE_IO.INC

        # Open file
        INT file
	FOPEN file O_RDWR|O_CREAT "TEXT.TXT"
        IF_FALSE
                # Failed!
                RETURN
                END_IF

        # Go to end of file
	FSET_POS file 0 SEEK_END

        # Go to beginning of file
        FSET_POS file 0

        # Go to offset 256 in file
        FSET_POS file 256

        # Seek forward 100 bytes
	FSET_POS file 100 SEEK_CUR

        # Seek backward 50 bytes
	FSET_POS file -50 SEEK_CUR

after 10 retries (one second apart), the current logic state will be set to
FALSE. All records that are locked should be subsequently unlocked before the
file is closed or any user interaction or lengthy processing is begun. This
function is the Baja equivalent of the C locking(int,LK_LOCK,long) function.

FUNLOCK <int_var> <int_var or #>
   args: handle    length
--------------------------------
This function is used to unlock a file record previously locked by the
current module. The current file position of 'handle' must be the start of
the record and the 'length' must be the same length as originally specified
to the FLOCK function. This function is the Baja equivalent of the C
locking(int,LK_UNLCK,long) function.

FPRINTF <int_var> <"cstr"> [any_var] [...]
   args: handle    format  variables
------------------------------------------
This function is very similar to the PRINTF and SPRINTF functions. The
exception is that the output of the formatted string is written to the current
file position of the file specified by 'handle'. This function is the
Baja equivalent of the standard C fprintf() function.

Example:
        # Variables
	INT file length time
        # Open for append
	FOPEN file O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_APPEND "TEXT.TXT"
        IF_FALSE
                # Failed!
                RETURN
                END_IF

        FGET_LENGTH file length
        FGET_TIME file time
        TIME_STR str time
	FPRINTF file "Length: %ld   Time: %s\r\n" length str
        FCLOSE file

FREAD_LINE <int_var> <any_var>
      args: handle    dest
------------------------------
Reads a single line from the open file specified by 'handle' into the
destination variable specified by 'dest'. If the destination variable is
a string variable, the terminating carriage return and line feed (if present
in the file) will be included in the string variable. You can use the
TRUNCSP function to remove them if needed.

If the read is successful, the current logic state is set to TRUE, otherwise
it is set to FALSE. This function is the Baja equivalent of the standard C
fgets() function.

FSET_ETX <#>
    args: etx
-------------
This function is used to set the end-of-text character for the current
shell or module. The default end-of-text character is 0. It is used by the
FREAD and FWRITE functions to pad/terminate string variables when read from
and writing to disk files. The 'etx' argument must be a number from 0 to 255.
Many of Synchronet's data files (USER.DAT, for example) use 3 (appears as
^C or a heart) for an end-of-text character. If you intend to read or write
from any files that use a non-zero end-of-text character, you'll want to use
this function before using FREAD or FWRITE.

File System Functions
=====================

These functions allow Baja modules to peform operations on unopened files.

CHKFILE <"str" or str_var>
   args: path_and_filename
--------------------------
This function checks for the existence of the 'path_and_filename' specified.
The path_and_filename should contain path and possibly drive specifications
(i.e. CHKFILE C:\MYDIR\MYFILE.TXT). If the file exists the current logic state
is set to TRUE, otherwise it is set to FALSE.

REMOVE_FILE <str_var>
       args: path_and_filename
------------------------------
This function attempts to remove the specified path_and_filename. If the
removal was successful, the current logic state is set to TRUE, otherwise it
is set to FALSE. This function is the Baja equivlanet of the standard C
unlink() and remove() functions.

RENAME_FILE <str_var> <str_var>
       args: source    dest
-------------------------------
This function attempts to rename the file specified as 'source' to the name
specified in 'dest'. If a different path is specified for 'dest', the drive
letter must be the same. If the renaming is successful, the current logic
state is set to TRUE, otherwise it is set to FALSE. This function is the
equivalent of the standard C rename() function.

COPY_FILE <str_var> <str_var>
     args: source    dest
-----------------------------
This function attempts to copy the file specified as 'source' to the path
AND filename specified in 'dest'. If the copy is successful, the current logic
state is set to TRUE, otherwise it is set to FALSE.

MOVE_FILE <str_var> <str_var>
     args: source    dest
-----------------------------
This function attepts to move the file specified as 'source' to the path
AND filename specified in 'dest'. If the source and dest paths are on the
same drive, this function is the same as a RENAME_FILE. If the source and
dest paths are on separate drives, then the this is the same as a COPY_FILE
with the exception that the source file is automatically deleted. If the
move is successful, the current logic state is set to TRUE, otherwise it is
set to FALSE.

GET_FILE_ATTRIB <int_var> <str_var>				DIR_ATTR.INC
	   args: dest	   file
-----------------------------------
This function retrieves the directory attributes for the file and writes them
into the dest variable. This function is the Baja equivalent of the C
_chmod(char *,0) function.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Synchronet                           86                   File System Functions


SET_FILE_ATTRIB <int_var> <str_var>				DIR_ATTR.INC
	   args: attrib    file
-----------------------------------
This function sets the directory attributes for the specified file according
to the attrib flags. This function is the Baja equivalent of the C
_chmod(char *,1) function. Valid attrib flags (defined in DIR_ATTR.INC) are:

Flag		Description
~~~~		~~~~~~~~~~~
FA_RDONLY	Read Only
FA_HIDDEN	Hiden
FA_SYSTEM	System
FA_LABEL	Volume Label
FA_DIREC	Directory (or subdirectory)
FA_ARCH 	Archive

Multiple flags may be specified by ORing the flags together with the OR (|)
symbol. Example:

	!INCLUDE DIR_ATTR.INC
	INT I
	SETSTR "MYFILE.TXT"
	SET I FA_HIDDEN|FA_SYSTEM
	SET_FILE_ATTRIB I STR

# End of DIR_ATTR.INC

GET_FILE_TIME <int_var> <str_var>
	 args: dest	 file
---------------------------------
Retrieves the current date/time stamp of the specified file and writes it
into the specified dest variable. If the date/time stamp could not be read
(file doesn't exist perhaps), the value -1 is written to the dest variable.

GET_FILE_LENGTH <int_var> <str_var>
	   args: dest	   file
-----------------------------------
Retrieves the current length of the specified file and writes it into the
specified dest variable. If the file doesn't exist, the value -1 is written
to the dest variable.

Directory System Functions
==========================

These functions allow Baja modules to peform operations on directories and
subdirectories of the local file system.

MAKE_DIR <str_var>
    args: dir
------------------
This function attempts to create the directory specified as dir. If the
directory is successfully created, the current logic state is set to TRUE,
otherwise it is set to FALSE and the system variable _ERRNO will contain
the reason. This function is the Baja equivalent of the standard C mkdir()
function.

CHANGE_DIR <str_var>
      args: dir
--------------------
This function attempts to change the current directory to the directory
specified in dir. Since Synchronet assumes the current directory is the
current NODE directory at all times, this is a very dangerous function
and should not be used unless absolutely necessary. If the directory is changed
successfully, the current logic state is set to TRUE, otherwise it is set to
FALSE and the system variable _ERRNO will contain the reason. This function
is the Baja equivalent of the standard C chdir() function.

REMOVE_DIR <str_var>
      args: dir
--------------------
This function attempts to remove the directory specified as dir. If the
removal is unnsuccessful (files in the directory, directory doesn't exist,
etc.) the current logic state will be set to FALSE and the system variable
_ERRNO will contain the reason. This function is the Baja equivalent of the
standard C rmdir() function.

OPEN_DIR <int_var> <str_var>
    args: handle    dir
----------------------------
This function attempts to open the directory specified as dir (should end
in a '.'). If the directory is successfully opened, the handle is set to
the directory handle and the current logic state is set to TRUE, otherwise
the logic state is set to FALSE. This function is the Baja equivalent of the
standard C opendir() function.

READ_DIR <int_var> <str_var>
    args: handle    filename
----------------------------
This function reads the next file name from the open directory handle and
puts it into the string variable specified as filename. If the read is
unsuccesful (no more files in directory) the current logic state is set to
FALSE and the system variable _ERRNO will contain the reason. This function
is the Baja equivalent of the standard C readdir() function.

REWIND_DIR <int_var>
      args: handle
--------------------
This function rewinds the open directory handle to the first directory entry
(file name). This function is the Baja equivalent of the standard C rewinddir()
function.

CLOSE_DIR <int_var>
     args: handle
-------------------
This function closes a previously opened directory handle. This function is
the Baja equivalent of the standard C closedir() function.

System Variables
================

System variables are global variables that are initialized and/or used by
Synchronet during operation. They should not be defined in your Baja module.
You must declare these variables by including (with !INCLUDE) SBBSDEFS.INC
or by declaring (with !GLOBAL) the individual variable names you wish to use.

These may be used anywhere a user-defined global variable may be used, with
the exception that many variables may not be written to (modified directly
by a shell or module). In some cases, there are specific Baja functions for
modifying otherwise "unmodifiable" system variables. These "Read Only" system
variables are indicated here with an asterisk (*).
