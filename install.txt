Installing Synchronet BBS for Win32 v3.0
========================================

This version has been succesfully tested with the 
following operating systems: Windows 95, Windows 98, 
Windows NT4, and Windows 2000.

If you are upgrading an existing installation of 
Synchronet (v2.3 or v3.0a), it is advised that you 
choose "Custom" Setup and disable the following
installation components:

	o Configuration Files
	o Text and Menu Files
	o External Programs

It is recommended that you install Synchronet into
the default installation directory (C:\SBBS). 
Installing into a location other than C:\SBBS will 
require  modification of the following files for full 
operation:

	o EXEC\VERT.BAT
	o EXEC\VERT.FTP
	o EXEC\TIMED.BAT
	o TEXT\BULLSEYE.CFG


SBBSCTRL
~~~~~~~~
SBBSCTRL is the Sysop's console for SBBS v3. You still 
must use SCFG to configure the BBS options shared between 
the new and old versions (this will be replaced with a GUI 
Configuration program at some point in the future).

The installation program will create a short-cut to 
SBBSCTRL.EXE on your desktop and in your startup folder 
(so Synchronet will start automatically during boot-up).

Auto-logon by IP is enabled in SBBSCTRL->Telnet->Configure 
and only users with the 'V' exemption can use this feature.


Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~
o DOSKEY must be loaded in your autoexec.bat for the DOS 
  shell to work right (Windows 95/98)
o Backspace doesn't work right in DOS shell (Windows 95/98)
o Can't ;RERUN v3 nodes
o First node (set in SBBSCTRL) configuration is used for all 
  nodes (this is actually intentional, i.e. not a bug)
o First node's temp directory must be set to "TEMP\"


Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ASCII exported versions of the Synchronet documentation are 
available in the DOCS directory. See CONTENTS.TXT for 
description of each file. To print the sysop manual type:
COPY \SBBS\DOCS\SYSOP.DOC PRN


Ordering/Registering Synchronet

Synchronet (as of April 1997) is FREEWARE - no registration or 
licensing fee is required.
