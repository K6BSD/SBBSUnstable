1. Disclaimer
=============
Although I have tested SlyEdit, I cannot guarantee that it is 100% bug free or
will work as expected in all environments in all cases.  That said, I hope you
find SlyEdit useful and enjoy using it.


2. Introduction
===============
SlyEdit is a message editor that I wrote in JavaScript for Synchronet, which
can mimic the look and feel of IceEdit or DCT Edit.  SlyEdit also supports
customization of colors via theme files, cross-posting into other message
areas, text search, and file import & export (works with files on the
BBS machine, and is enabled only for the sysop).

The motivation for creating this was that IceEdit and DCT Edit were always
my two favorite BBS message editors, but in a world where 32-bit (and 64-bit)
Windows and *nix platforms are common, 16-bit DOS emulation is required to run
IceEdit and DCT Edit, which is noticeably slow and sometimes unreliable.
Since SlyEdit is written in JavaScript, it is faster than a DOS-based message
editor and can run in any environment in which Synchronet runs, without any
modification or being re-compiled.

SlyEdit will recognize the user's terminal size and set up the screen
accordingly.  The width of the edit area will always be 80 characters and
support up to 79 characters; however, an increased terminal size will provide
more room for message information to be displayed.  Also, a terminal height
greater than the standard 24 or 25 characters will provide a taller edit area,
allowing more of the message to be seen on the screen at a time.

Also, SlyEdit has no moving parts that can wear out over time.

Thanks go out to the following people for testing:
- Nick of Lightning BBS (lightningbbs.dyndns.org) for testing early versions
- Nick (AKA Access Denied) of The Pharcyde (pharcyde.org) for testing the
  newer versions and for his input on various features, mainly message quoting
- echicken (sysop of Electronic Chicken) for his solution to look up the
  original author of a message after a user changes the "To" name when
  replying to a message

3. Installation & Setup
=======================
These are the steps for installation:
 1. Extract the archive.  If you're viewing this file, then you've probably
    already done this. :)
 2. There are 2 ways SlyEdit's files can be copied onto your Synchronet system:
    1. Copy the JavaScript files into your sbbs/exec directory and the .cfg files
       into your sbbs/ctrl directory.  If you plan to customize your SlyEdit.cfg
       or color theme files, it's recommended to also put the .cfg files in your
       sbbs/mods directory so that your configuration won't be accidentally
       overwritten when updating the files from the Synchronet CVS repository.
       SlyEdit will first check the sbbs/mods directory for the configuration
       files, then sbbs/ctrl, and then SlyEdit's own directory for the
       configuration files.  In other words, the SlyEdit configuration files
       in sbbs/mods take first precedence, sbbs/ctrl 2nd precedence, and
       SlyEdit's own directory takes last precedence for the configuration
       files.
    2. Copy all files together into their own directory of your choice
 3. Set up SlyEdit on your BBS with Synchronet's configration program (SCFG).

SlyEdit can be set to mimic IceEdit or DCT Edit via a command-line parameter.
The values for this parameter are as follows:
  ICE: Mimic the IceEdit look & feel
  DCT: Mimic the DCT Edit look & feel
  RANDOM: Randomly select either the IceEdit or DCT Edit look & feel

To add SlyEdit to Synchronet's list of external editors, run Synchronet's
configuration program (SCFG) and select "External Programs", and then
"External Editors".  The following describes setting up SlyEdit using the
ICE parameter for IceEdit emulation:
 1. Scroll down to the empty slot in the editor list and press Enter to
    select it.
 2. For the external editor name, enter "SlyEdit (Ice style)" (without the quotes)
    (or similar, depending on your personal preference)
 3. For the internal code, use SLYEDICE (or whatever you want, depending on your
    personal preference)
 4. Press Enter to select and edit the new entry.  Asuming that the .js files
    are in the sbbs/exect directory, the settings should be as follows:
      Command line: ?SlyEdit.js %f ICE
      Access requirement string: ANSI
      Intercept standard I/O: No
      Native (32-bit) Executable: No
      Use Shell to Execute: No
      Quoted Text: All
      Editor Information Files: QuickBBS MSGINF/MSGTMP
      Expand Line Feeds to CRLF: Yes
      Strip FidoNet Kludge Lines: No
      BBS Drop File Type: None
    After you've added SlyEdit, your Synchronet configuration window should look
    like this:
    +[¦][?]--------------------------------------------------------------+
    ¦                      SlyEdit (Ice style) Editor                    ¦

    +--------------------------------------------------------------------+

    For DCT Edit mode, use DCT in place of ICE on the command line.  For
    random mode, use RANDOM in place of ICE.

    Note that if you placed the files in a different directory, then the
    command line should include the full path to SlyEdit.js.  For example,
    if SlyEdit was placed in sbbs/xtrn/SlyEdit, then the command line would
    be /BBS/sbbs/xtrn/DigDist/SlyEdit/SlyEdit.js %f ICE


4. Features
===========
As mentioned earlier, SlyEdit is can mimic the look & feel of IceEdit or
DCT Edit.  It also has the following features:
- Text search: Allows the user to search for text in the message.  If
  the text is found, the message area will scroll to it, and it will be
  highlighted.  Repeated searches for the same text will look for the
  next occurrance of that text.
- Message quoting: When replying to a message, users can select lines from the
  message to quote.  By default, SlyEdit puts the initials of the original
  author in front of the quote lines to indicate who originally wrote those
  parts of the message.  Optionally, sysops may disable the use of initials
  in quote lines, in which case SlyEdit simply prefixes quote lines with " > "
  as was done in IceEdit, DCT Edit, and other editors of the early-mid 1990s.
- Cross-posting into other message sub-boards: When posting a message to a
  message sub-board, SlyEdit allows the user to select other message sub-boards
  to post the message into.  SlyEdit will post the message to the user's
  current message sub-board by default.  Using the cross-post feature, the
  user can select any number of other message sub-boards to cross-post his/her
  message into.  SlyEdit respects the ARS security setting for each sub-board -
  If a user is not allowed to post in a message sub-board, SlyEdit will not
  allow the user to select that sub-board for cross-posting.  The user can also
  un-select their current message sub-board.  When the user un-selects their
  current message sub-board and chooses other message sub-boards to post
  his/her message into, Synchronet will say that the message was aborted
  because the message file wasn't saved as it normally is for the current
  message sub-board.  However, SlyEdit will output all of the message
  sub-boards that the message was posted into.  If the user un-selected their
  current message sub-board, SlyEdit will also output a note explaining that
  the BBS will say the message was aborted, even though it was posted into
  other sub-boards and that is normal.
- Navigation: Page up/down, home/end of line, and arrow keys
- Slash commands (at the start of the line):
  /A: Abort
  /S: Save
  /Q: Quote message
  /C: Cross-post message sub-board selection
- Sysops can import a file (stored on the BBS machine) into the message
- Sysops can export the current message to a file (on the BBS machine)
- Configuration file with behavior and color settings.  See section 4
  (Configuration File) for more information.

The following is a summary of the keyboard shortcuts (from SlyEdit's command
help screen):

5. Digital Distortion Message Lister note
-----------------------------------------
If you use Digital Distortion's Message Lister, you must update it to version
1.36 or newer in order to properly work with this version of SlyEdit when
replying to messages.  See the file "Message Lister notes.txt" for a more
detailed explanation.

6. Configuration file
=====================
The configuration file, SlyEdit.cfg, is split up into 3 sections -
Behavior, Ice colors, and DCT colors.  These sections are designated
by [BEHAVIOR], [ICE_COLORS], and [DCT_COLORS], respectively.  These
settings are described below:

Behavior settings
-----------------
Setting                           Description
-------                           -----------
displayEndInfoScreen              Whether or not to display the info
                                  screen when SlyEdit exits.  Valid values
                                  are true and false.  If this option is
                                  not specified, this feature will be
                                  enabled by default.

userInputTimeout                  Whether or not to use an input timeout
                                  for users.  Valid values are true and
                                  false.  Note: The input timeout is not
                                  used for sysops.  If this option is not
                                  specified, this feature will be enabled
                                  by default.

inputTimeoutMS                    The amount of time (in milliseconds) to
                                  use for the input timeout.  If this option
                                  is not specified, this option will default
                                  to 300000.

reWrapQuoteLines                  Whether or not to re-wrap quote lines. Valid
                                  values are true and false.  This feature is
                                  enabled by default.  With this feature
                                  enabled, SlyEdit will re-wrap quote lines
                                  to still be complete and readable after the
                                  quote prefix character is added to the front
                                  of the quote lines.  SlyEdit is able to
                                  recognize quote lines beginning with >
                                  or 2 letters and a > (such as EO>).  If this
                                  feature is disabled, quote lines will simply
                                  be trimmed to make room for the quote prefix
                                  character to be added to the front.

add3rdPartyStartupScript          Add a 3rd-party JavaScript script to execute
                                  (via loading) upon startup of SlyEdit.  The
                                  parameter must specify the full path & filename
                                  of the JavaScript script.  For example (using
                                  the excellent Desafortunadamente add-on by Art
                                  of Fat Cats BBS):
                                  add3rdPartyStartupScript=D:/BBS/sbbs/xtrn/desafortunadamente/desafortunadamente.js

addJSOnStart                      Add a JavaScript command to run on startup.  Any
                                  commands added this way will be executed after
                                  3rd-party scripts are loaded.
                                  Example (using the excellent Desafortunadamente
                                  add-on by Art of Fat Cats BBS):
                                  addJSOnStart=fortune_load();

add3rdPartyExitScript             Add a 3rd-party JavaScript script to execute
                                  (via loading) upon exit of SlyEdit.  The
                                  parameter must specify the full path & filename
                                  of the JavaScript script.

addJSOnExit                       Add a JavaScript command to run on exit.
                                  Example (don't actually do this):
                                  addJSOnStart=console.print("Hello\r\n\1p");

allowCrossPosting                 Whether or not to allow cross-posting
                                  messages into different/multiple message
                                  sub-boards.  Valid values are true and false.

enableTextReplacements            Toggles the use of text replacements (AKA
                                  macros) as the user types a message.  Valid
                                  values are true, false, and regex.  If regex
                                  is used, text replacements will be enabled
                                  and used as regular expressions as
                                  implemented by JavaScript.  For more
                                  information, see section 10 (Text
                                  replacements (AKA Macros)).

tagLineFilename                   Specifies the name of the file that stores
                                  taglines, which users can optionally choose
                                  from to be appended to their message upon
                                  saving the message.

taglinePrefix                     Some text to be added to the front of
                                  a tagline that is selected from the user.
                                  The intention of this setting is to
                                  differentiate taglines from the rest of the
                                  message.  This defaults to the string "... "
                                  (3 dots and a space).  If desired, this can
                                  be set to a blank string (nothing after the
                                  =) - for instance, if you only want to put
                                  double quotes around text lines, you could
                                  set this to blank and enable the
                                  quoteTagLines setting.

quoteTaglines                     Whether or not to put selected taglines in
                                  double quotes.  This defaults to false.  If
                                  you like taglines to have double quotes and
                                  no prefix, you can set this to true and set
                                  taglinePrefix to a blank string (nothing
                                  after the =).

shuffleTaglines                   Whether or not to shuffle (randomize) the
                                  list of taglines displayed to the user for
                                  selection.

allowUserSettings                 Whether or not to allow users to configure
                                  their own user settings.  This defaults to
                                  true.

useQuoteLineInitials              Whether or not to prefix quoted message lines
                                  with the previous author's initials when
                                  replying to a message.  Valued values are
                                  true and false.  If this setting is disabled,
                                  SlyEdit will simply prefix the quoted lines
                                  with " > ", as was done in IceEdit, DCT Edit,
                                  and other message editors of the early-mid
                                  1990s.  This setting is enabled by default.
                                  This setting serves as the default for the
                                  user setting, which users can configure in
                                  their own settings.

10. Text replacements (AKA Macros)
==================================
SlyEdit version 1.29 added text replacements (AKA Macros), which lets you (the
sysop) define words to be replaced with other text as the user types a message.
This feature can be used, for instance, to replace commonly misspelled words
with their correct versions or to replace swear words with less offensive
words.  This feature is toggled by the enableTextReplacements option in
SlyEdit.cfg can can have one of three values:
false : Text replacement is disabled
true  : Text replacement is enabled and performed as literal search and replace
regex : Text replacement is enabled using regular expressions as implemented by
        JavaScript (more accurately, Synchronet's JavaScript interpreter, which
        at the time of this writing is Mozilla's JavaScript engine (AKA
        JavaScript-C or "SpiderMonkey").

The text searches are performed on single words only, as the user types the
message, and are replaced by whatever text you configure for the word.  The
configuration for text replacing is read from a configuration file called
SlyEdit_TextReplacements.cfg, which is plain text and can be placed in either
sbbs/ctrl or in the same directory as SlyEdit's .js files (SlyEdit.js,
SlyEdit_Misc.js, etc.).  Each line in SlyEdit_TextReplacements.cfg needs to
have the following format:
originalWord=replacementText
where originalWord is the word to be replaced, and replacementText is the text
to replace the word with.

The options for the enableTextReplacements configuration optoin are explained
in more detail below:

- false: Text replacing is disabled

- true: Literal text search and replace - The words will be matched literally
and replaced with the text on the right side of the = in
SlyEdit_TextReplacements.cfg.  In this mode, word matching is not
case-sensitive.  The words can have both uppercase and lowercase letters and
will still be matched to the words configured in SlyEdit_TextReplacements.cfg.
In this mode, if the first letter of the original word is uppercase, then the
first letter of the replaced text will also be uppercase.
While this works, one drawback to literal text searching is that it won't
replace a word if there are punctuation characters or other characters around
the word or if the word is misspelled.

- regex: With this option, SlyEdit will treat the word searches (on the left
side of the = in SlyEdit_TextReplacements.cfg) as regular expressions, as
implemented by JavaScript.  When using regular expressions, SlyEdit will start
trying all the regular expressions provided and apply only the first one that
changes the text and will stop there.
Regular expressions offer a more flexible way to serach and replace text.  For
example, in case a word is surrounded by punctuation or other characters, a
regular expression can be given that will still match the word.  For example,
you might want a regular expression that changes "teh" to "the" (since "teh"
is a common misspelling of "the").  To ensure that the word is replaced even if
the word has other characters around it, you could use a regular exprssion and
replacement such as this:
(.*)teh(.*)=$1the$2
That way, even if the word is enclosed in quotes (such as "teh"), the word will
still be converted to "the".  And to preserve the first letter's case (if it's
uppercase or lowercase), this regular expression and replacement string would
handle that:
(.*)([tT])eh(.*)=$1$2he$3
SlyEdit applies the regular expressions on a per-word basis; that is, the
expression .* in a regular expression will match any characters only in the
last word the user typed, not the entire line.

For more information on regular expressions, the
following are some web pages that explain them:

JavaScript-specific information on regular exprssions:

One nice thing about JavaScript's implementation (among others) of regular
expressions is that it supports the use of parentheses for character grouping
and backreferencing to place a portion of the matched text in the replacement
text.  In JavaScript, each numbered capture buffer is preceded by a dollar sign
($).  For example, the regular expression (darn) will match the word "darn" and
store it in buffer 1, and in JavaScript (and with SlyEdit's search and
replace), you would use $1 to refer to the word "darn".  For example, for
(darn), the replacement $1it would replace the word "darn" with "darnit".

11. User settings
=================
SlyEdit version 1.32 added the ability for each user to configure some settings
for themselves.  The user settings include the following:
- Whether or not to enable the option to use taglines
- Whether or not to add the original author's initials to quote lines
  (this was previously only configurable in SlyEdit.cfg)
- Whether or not to indent quote lines that use author's intials (this was
  previously only configurable in SlyEdit.cfg)

The user settings files will be stored in the sbbs/data/user directory with the
filename <user number>.SlyEdit_Settings, and the user number will be 0-padded
up to 4 digits.

12. Taglines
============
SlyEdit version 1.32 added the ability for users to optionally choose a tagline
to be appended to their message upon saving the message.  Each user can
configure in their user settings whether or not they want to enable this
feature.  The setting enableTaglines in SlyEdit.cfg sets the default setting,
but users are free to change it for themselves.

The taglines are loaded from the text file SlyEdit_Taglines.txt, which can be
located in any of the following directories, searched in the following order:
- sbbs/mods
- sbbs/ctrl
- The same directory as SlyEdit's .js files
